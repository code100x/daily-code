### Project ideas

#### LLM-Integrated Quiz for DailyCode
##### Summary
DailyCode is a core feature of 100xDevs, designed to help developers practice and refine their coding skills. This project aims to integrate an LLM into DailyCode so that for every new module added, the LLM automatically generates quizzes. Additionally, there will be a dedicated quiz section where time-based quizzes are created, allowing users to test their understanding effectively.

##### Expected outcomes
- LLM integration to generate quizzes dynamically for each module.
- A separate quiz section with time-based quizzes.
- A structured database for quiz storage and tracking user progress.
- A well-documented and scalable implementation.

##### Implementation
This project will require integrating an LLM API into the DailyCode platform. The implementation will include designing a robust quiz generation system, building a UI for the quiz section, and ensuring the quizzes align with the added modules. The backend will store quiz data, track progress, and manage timing logic.

#### Blogging Platform with Admin & Super Admin Dashboards
##### Summary
This project aims to transform 100xDevs into a blogging platform where users can write articles, submit them for review, and get them published by admins. An admin and super admin dashboard will be created to manage articles, approve/reject submissions, and oversee the platform.

##### Expected outcomes
- A blogging system where users can write and submit articles.
- An admin dashboard for managing submissions.
- A super admin dashboard with higher-level controls.
- A seamless publishing workflow with role-based access control.

##### Implementation
The project will involve building a CMS-like structure within 100xDevs. The frontend will allow users to draft and submit articles, while admins will have tools to review and publish content. Super admins will oversee all activities. The backend will manage article storage, user roles, and approval workflows.
