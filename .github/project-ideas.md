### Project ideas

#### LLM-Integrated Quiz for DailyCode

##### Summary

DailyCode is a core feature of 100xDevs, designed to help developers practice and refine their coding skills. This project aims to integrate an LLM into DailyCode so that for every new module added, the LLM automatically generates quizzes. Additionally, there will be a dedicated quiz section where time-based quizzes are created, allowing users to test their understanding effectively.

##### Expected outcomes

- LLM integration to generate quizzes dynamically for each module.
- A separate quiz section with time-based quizzes.
- A structured database for quiz storage and tracking user progress.
- A well-documented and scalable implementation.

##### Implementation

This project will require integrating an LLM API into the DailyCode platform. The implementation will include designing a robust quiz generation system, building a UI for the quiz section, and ensuring the quizzes align with the added modules. The backend will store quiz data, track progress, and manage timing logic.

### Project proposal: your own idea

You can also propose your own idea. Your proposal should:

- Have a concrete task.
- Give a solid idea of what will constitute success. You tell us.
- Present a detailed design specification.
- Give insight into who you are. If you propose something ambitious, convince us that you are up to the task.
- Give insight into your previous projects and experience.
- Tell us about your experience with TypeScript, TailwindCSS, PostgreSQL, and Recoil.
- Provide a schedule, including a detailed work breakdown and major milestones.
- Contain your motivation and curriculum vitae.

#### Note:

- The project ideas above are starting points for your submission, but aren’t enough by themselves. You’ll need to come up with a more complete project plan and use your own words.
- Do not feel limited to the project ideas above.
- If you have a project idea not listed, please direct message the organization admins. They can evaluate its feasibility and pair you with a mentor for initial feedback.

### Project proposals should fall into one of three categories:

1. Work on 100xDevs itself (core product).
2. Work on tools to support 100xDevs.
3. Development of third-party integrations or libraries.

### The project you propose should be:

- Useful for 100xDevs.
- A single well-scoped project.
- Achievable within the GSoC timeframe.
- Something the core developers can help mentor you on.
