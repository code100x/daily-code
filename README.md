## File Documentation

### Root

<a id='-eslintrc-js'></a>

#### .eslintrc.js

*Path: .eslintrc.js*

1. **Purpose:** This file defines the ESLint configuration for the root of the repository, specifically targeting the package manager's execution context. It sets up linting rules and configurations that apply only to files within the root, excluding subdirectories like "apps" and "packages."

2. **Key Functionality:**

- **`ignorePatterns: ["apps/**", "packages/**"]`**: This configuration instructs ESLint to ignore all files and subdirectories within the "apps" and "packages" directories. This is crucial for applying different linting rules to different parts of the project, allowing for more specific configurations within those subdirectories.

- **`extends: ["@repo/eslint-config/library.js"]`**: This line extends the base ESLint configuration defined in the "@repo/eslint-config/library.js" file. This promotes consistency across the project by inheriting a shared set of rules and configurations.  This indicates a dependency on an internal package or shared configuration file.

- **`parser: "@typescript-eslint/parser"`**: Specifies the parser to be used by ESLint.  "@typescript-eslint/parser" allows ESLint to understand TypeScript syntax. This implies the project uses TypeScript.

- **`parserOptions: { project: true }`**: This option tells the TypeScript parser to look for a `tsconfig.json` file in the current directory or any parent directory. This allows ESLint to leverage TypeScript's type checking capabilities for more accurate linting.

- **`rules: { ... }`**: This object allows overriding or extending specific rules inherited from the extended configuration.

    - **`"no-unused-vars": "off"`**: Disables the rule that warns about unused variables. This might be necessary due to specific coding patterns or tooling used in the root directory.

    - **`"no-redeclare": "off"`**: Disables the rule that prevents variable redeclaration.  Similar to the above, this might be disabled for specific reasons within the root's context.


3. **Dependencies and Relationships:**

- **Imports & Usage:** This file implicitly depends on ESLint and the "@typescript-eslint/parser" package. It also depends on an internal ESLint configuration file located at "@repo/eslint-config/library.js".
- **Code Relationships:** This file serves as the base ESLint configuration for the root of the repository.  It's likely that other ESLint configuration files within "apps" and "packages" will extend or modify this base configuration, creating a hierarchical structure of linting rules.

4. **Usage Example:**  N/A (Configuration file, not directly executed)

5. **Technical Notes:**

- The decision to ignore "apps" and "packages" suggests a multi-package or monorepo structure where different parts of the project have distinct linting needs.
- Disabling "no-unused-vars" and "no-redeclare" at the root level might indicate a need for more granular control over these rules within subdirectories.  It's important to understand the rationale behind disabling these rules to avoid potential code quality issues.
- The use of a shared ESLint configuration ("@repo/eslint-config/library.js") promotes consistency and maintainability across the project. This shared configuration likely contains the core linting rules for the project.

### apps/web

<a id='apps-web--eslintrc-js'></a>

#### .eslintrc.js

*Path: apps/web/.eslintrc.js*

1.  **Purpose:** This file configures ESLint for the web application, ensuring code style and quality consistency. It extends a shared ESLint configuration and sets up TypeScript parsing.

2.  **Key Functionality:**

    -   `root: true`: Prevents ESLint from searching up the directory tree for other configuration files. This ensures that the project's ESLint configuration is self-contained.
    -   `extends: ["@repo/eslint-config/next.js"]`: Extends a predefined ESLint configuration specifically designed for Next.js projects within the repository. This promotes consistency across different Next.js applications in the monorepo.
    -   `parser: "@typescript-eslint/parser"`: Specifies the parser to use for TypeScript files. This allows ESLint to understand TypeScript syntax and apply relevant linting rules.
    -   `parserOptions: { project: true }`: Tells the TypeScript parser to infer project settings from the `tsconfig.json` file. This enables type-aware linting and autocompletion.

3.  **Dependencies and Relationships:**

    -   **Imports & Usage:** Depends on `eslint` and `@typescript-eslint/parser`.  It leverages the shared ESLint config `@repo/eslint-config/next.js`.
    -   **Code Relationships:** This file is essential for the development workflow, ensuring code quality and consistency across the web application. It's used by ESLint during code linting.

4.  **Usage Example:**  ESLint automatically uses this configuration file when linting files within the `apps/web` directory. Developers can run ESLint manually using commands like `npx eslint .` or integrate it into their IDE for real-time linting.

5.  **Technical Notes:**  Using a shared ESLint configuration (`@repo/eslint-config/next.js`) promotes maintainability and consistency across multiple projects within the repository.

---

3.  **Dependencies and Relationships:**

    -   **Imports & Usage:** Depends on the `@types/next` package, which provides TypeScript definitions for Next.js.
    -   **Code Relationships:** This file is crucial for TypeScript integration with Next.js. It ensures that TypeScript can correctly type-check code that uses Next.js APIs.

4.  **Usage Example:**  This file is automatically used by TypeScript when compiling the Next.js application. It doesn't require explicit usage in the codebase.

5.  **Technical Notes:**  This file is automatically generated by Next.js and should not be manually edited.

---

        -   `resolve.alias`: Creates aliases for paths like `@components` and `@styles`.
        -   `plugins`: Adds a `ContextReplacementPlugin` to handle the `keyv` package dependency.
    -   `transpilePackages`: Specifies packages that should be transpiled by Next.js. This is useful for packages that are not written in ES5 and need to be transpiled for browser compatibility.
    -   `images.domains`: Whitelists domains for image optimization. This allows Next.js to optimize images from these domains.

3.  **Dependencies and Relationships:**

    -   **Imports & Usage:** Depends on `next`, `path`, and `webpack`.
    -   **Code Relationships:** This file is crucial for configuring the build process of the Next.js application. It affects how webpack bundles the code, handles dependencies, and optimizes images.

4.  **Usage Example:**  This file is automatically used by Next.js during the build process.

5.  **Technical Notes:**  The `webpack` configuration modifications improve developer experience by simplifying imports and resolving potential dependency issues. The `transpilePackages` setting ensures compatibility with specific packages.

---

<a id='apps-web-postcss-config-js'></a>

#### postcss.config.js

*Path: apps/web/postcss.config.js*

- Tailwind CSS provides a utility-first approach for styling, promoting consistency and reducing custom CSS.
- The `@layer` directive helps organize styles and ensures proper precedence.

---

<a id='apps-web-app-layout-tsx'></a>

#### layout.tsx

*Path: apps/web/app/layout.tsx*

1. **Purpose:** This file defines the main layout of the web application. It sets up the global font, theme provider, top loader, and wraps the application content with necessary providers.

2. **Key Functionality:**

- **Font Integration:** Uses the `Poppins` font from `next/font/google`.
- **Theme Provider:** Wraps the application with `ThemeProvider` from `../components/Providers` to manage theme switching (light/dark mode).  Uses the `attribute="class"` prop, indicating theme changes are handled by CSS classes (like the `.dark` class in `globals.css`).

- **Imports & Usage:** Imports the `Landing` component from `../screens/Landing`.
- **Code Relationships:** This file is the entry point for the main page content and determines what is displayed on the root route.

4. **Usage Example:** This file represents the root route of the application. When a user visits the base URL, this component is rendered.

5. **Technical Notes:**  The simplicity suggests the `Landing` component holds the primary logic and content for the main page.


**Overall System Architecture and Relationships:**

- `globals.css` provides the global styles for the application.
- `layout.tsx` sets up the layout, including the theme provider, font, and global providers, and imports the styles from `globals.css`.
- `page.tsx` defines the content of the main application page, rendering the `Landing` component.
- `page.module.css` is currently unused but is intended for page-specific styles.

The files work together to create a styled and structured web application. `layout.tsx` acts as a container for all page content, applying global styles and providing necessary context. `page.tsx` determines the specific content displayed on the root route.  The system is designed with a clear separation of concerns: layout, styling, and page content.

### apps/web/app/(marketing)

<a id='apps-web-app-(marketing)-layout-tsx'></a>

#### layout.tsx

*Path: apps/web/app/(marketing)/layout.tsx*

1. **Purpose:** This file defines the `MarketingLayout` component, which provides a consistent layout structure for marketing pages within the web application. It wraps child components with a header (AppbarClient) and footer.

2. **Key Functionality:**

- **`MarketingLayout` Component:**
    - **Parameters:**
        - `children`: `React.ReactNode` -  The content to be rendered within the layout. This allows any valid React component or JSX to be passed as children to the layout.
    - **Return Type:** `JSX.Element` -  Renders the layout structure containing the header, children, and footer.
    - **Implementation:** The component uses a `main` element with styling for background and minimum height. It renders the `AppbarClient` component at the top, followed by the provided `children`, and finally the `Footer` component.

3. **Dependencies and Relationships:**

- **Imports & Usage:**
    - `React`: Used for JSX and component creation.
    - `Footer`: Imports the `Footer` component, presumably from `../../screens/footer`. This suggests a directory structure where shared UI components are located in a `screens` or `components` directory.
    - `AppbarClient`: Imports the `AppbarClient` component, likely a customized app bar for client-facing marketing pages, from `../../components/AppbarClient`.
- **Code Relationships:** This layout component is likely used within the marketing section of the web application, wrapping specific marketing pages to provide a consistent look and feel. It depends on the `Footer` and `AppbarClient` components.

4. **Usage Example:**

```tsx
// Inside a marketing page component, e.g., /pages/marketing/pricing.tsx
import MarketingLayout from "../(marketing)/layout";

const PricingPage = () => {
  return (
    <MarketingLayout>
      {/* Pricing page content */}
      <h1>Pricing</h1>
      <p>Our pricing plans...</p>
    </MarketingLayout>
  );
};

export default PricingPage;

```

This example demonstrates how a marketing page (`PricingPage`) uses the `MarketingLayout` to wrap its content.  The `PricingPage` component's JSX is passed as the `children` prop to `MarketingLayout`, resulting in a consistent layout across marketing pages.

5. **Technical Notes:**

- The use of a dedicated layout component promotes reusability and maintainability by centralizing the layout structure.
- The relative import paths (`../../screens/footer`, `../../components/AppbarClient`) suggest a well-organized project structure.  This structure likely uses a shared components directory and separates components by their function (e.g., client-facing vs. internal).
- The `className` attribute uses tailwind CSS classes (`min-h-screen`, `bg-background`, `antialiased`) for styling. This indicates the project likely uses Tailwind CSS for styling.

### apps/web/app/(marketing)/(policy)/privacy-policy

<a id='apps-web-app-(marketing)-(policy)-privacy-policy-page-tsx'></a>

#### page.tsx

*Path: apps/web/app/(marketing)/(policy)/privacy-policy/page.tsx*

1. **Purpose:** This file defines the `PrivacyPolicyPage` component, responsible for rendering the privacy policy content on the website's marketing section. It displays the privacy policy information fetched from a shared component.

2. **Key Functionality:**

- **`PrivacyPolicyPage` Component:** This functional component renders the privacy policy content.
    - **Parameters:** None
    - **Return Type:** `JSX.Element`
    - **Implementation:** It iterates through the `privacyPolicyContent` array (imported from `../../../../components/privacy-policy/privacy-policy`) and renders each item's description within a `<p>` tag. The content is structured within a main container with styling for responsiveness.

3. **Dependencies and Relationships:**

- **Imports & Usage:** Imports `privacyPolicyContent` from `../../../../components/privacy-policy/privacy-policy`. This indicates a dependency on a shared component for the actual policy content.  This structure suggests a separation of concerns, with the content managed centrally and reused across different parts of the application.
- **Code Relationships:** This component is likely routed within the application's routing configuration (e.g., using Next.js's file-based routing) to be accessible at the `/privacy-policy` route under the marketing section.

4. **Usage Example:**

This component would be rendered when a user navigates to the privacy policy page within the marketing section of the website.  For example, in a Next.js application, the file's location in the `app` directory automatically handles routing.

5. **Technical Notes:**

- The component uses a simple mapping function to render the policy content. This assumes that `privacyPolicyContent` is an array of objects, each with an `id` and `description` property.
- The styling uses Tailwind CSS classes for layout and responsiveness.

### apps/web/app/(marketing)/tnc

<a id='apps-web-app-(marketing)-tnc-page-tsx'></a>

#### page.tsx

*Path: apps/web/app/(marketing)/tnc/page.tsx*

1. **Purpose:** This file defines the `TermsAndConditionsPage` component, responsible for rendering the terms and conditions content on a web page. It dynamically displays the content from a data source.

2. **Key Functionality:**

- **`TermsAndConditionsPage` (functional component):**
    - **Parameters:** None
    - **Return Type:** `JSX.Element` (React component)
    - **Implementation:** This component iterates through the `tncContent` array (imported from `../../../components/tnc/tnc-content`).  It renders an `h1` element for the title and then maps over the `tncContent` array. For each item in the array, it renders a `div` containing a description paragraph and a nested loop to render a list of points associated with that item. Each point is rendered as a paragraph with an ID and description.
    - **Error Handling/Fallback:**  No explicit error handling is present. If `tncContent` is empty or undefined, the rendered output will simply contain the title and no content below it.

3. **Dependencies and Relationships:**

- **Imports & Usage:**
    - `tncContent` from `../../../components/tnc/tnc-content`: This import provides the data for the terms and conditions. The file structure suggests this is a relative import within the same project, indicating a close relationship between the components.
- **Code Relationships:** This component likely fits within a larger web application structure, potentially routed using a framework like Next.js.  It depends on the `tncContent` data, suggesting a separation of content and presentation.

4. **Usage Example:**

This component would be used as a route within a web application.  In a Next.js application, for example, it might be placed in the `pages` directory to be directly accessible via a URL.

```javascript
// Example in a Next.js routes directory
// pages/terms.tsx
import TermsAndConditionsPage from './(marketing)/tnc/page';

export default TermsAndConditionsPage;
```

5. **Technical Notes:**

- The component uses a simple mapping approach to render the content. For more complex terms and conditions with dynamic sections or interactive elements, a more structured approach with reusable sub-components might be beneficial for maintainability.
- The key prop is used correctly within the mapping functions, which is crucial for React's reconciliation process and performance.  However, if the `item.id` and `point.id` are not guaranteed to be unique, this could lead to issues.  A more robust approach might involve generating unique keys if they are not readily available.
- The relative import path `../../../components/tnc/tnc-content` suggests a specific project structure.  While relative imports are common, deeply nested paths can sometimes indicate a need for refactoring to improve code organization.  Consider evaluating if the project structure could be optimized for simpler import paths.

### apps/web/app/admin

<a id='apps-web-app-admin-layout-tsx'></a>

#### layout.tsx

*Path: apps/web/app/admin/layout.tsx*

1. **Purpose:** This file defines the layout for the admin section of the web application. It primarily handles authentication and authorization, ensuring only authorized users can access admin pages.

2. **Key Functionality:**

- **`AdminLayout` (functional component):**
    - **Parameters:**
        - `children`: `ReactNode` - The content to be rendered within the layout.
    - **Return Type:** `JSX.Element` or `null`
    - **Implementation:**
        - Uses `getServerSession(authOptions)` to retrieve the user's session from NextAuth.js.
        - Checks `session?.user?.admin`. If false (user not logged in or not an admin), renders an "Access Denied" page with a link to the homepage.
        - If true (user is an admin), renders the provided `children` within the layout.
    - **Fallback Mechanism:**  If the user is not authorized, a specific access denied page is displayed, guiding the user back to the homepage.

3. **Dependencies and Relationships:**

- **Imports & Usage:**
    - `getServerSession` from `next-auth`: Used for server-side authentication.
    - `authOptions` from `../../lib/auth`: Configuration options for NextAuth.js.
    - `Link` from `next/link`: Used for client-side navigation.
    - `LockClosedIcon` from `@radix-ui/react-icons`: Used for the visual lock icon.
    - `ReactNode` from `react`: Defines the type for React children.
- **Code Relationships:** This layout component is used to wrap any page within the admin section (e.g., `/admin`). It depends on the authentication logic defined in `../../lib/auth`.

4. **Usage Example:**

```tsx
// In a page within the admin section (e.g., /admin/dashboard)
import AdminLayout from './layout';

export default function DashboardPage() {
  return (
    <AdminLayout>
      {/* Admin-specific content */}
    </AdminLayout>
  );
}
```

5. **Technical Notes:**

- Server-side rendering with `getServerSession` ensures that authentication is handled before the page is sent to the client, improving security.
- The `authOptions` likely contain the configuration for connecting to the authentication provider.

---

<a id='apps-web-app-admin-page-tsx'></a>

#### page.tsx

*Path: apps/web/app/admin/page.tsx*

1. **Purpose:** This file defines the main entry point for the admin section of the application. It renders the admin layout and the core admin content.

2. **Key Functionality:**

- **`AdminPage` (functional component):**
    - **Parameters:** None
    - **Return Type:** `JSX.Element`
    - **Implementation:** Renders the `AppbarClient` component and the `Admin` component within the layout structure.

3. **Dependencies and Relationships:**

- **Imports & Usage:**
    - `AppbarClient` from `../../components/AppbarClient`: The application's app bar component, likely providing navigation and other UI elements.
    - `Admin` from `../../screens/Admin`: The main content component for the admin section.
- **Code Relationships:** This page component uses the `AppbarClient` for consistent UI and the `Admin` component to display the admin-specific content. It is likely routed to the `/admin` path.  It is wrapped by `layout.tsx`, which provides the authentication layer.

4. **Usage Example:** This component is typically accessed by navigating to the `/admin` route.

5. **Technical Notes:**

- This file demonstrates a clear separation of concerns: `AdminPage` handles the page structure, `AppbarClient` handles the app bar, and `Admin` handles the specific admin content.
- This structure makes the code more modular and maintainable.  The relationship between `page.tsx` and `layout.tsx` is crucial for securing the admin section of the application.  `layout.tsx` acts as a gatekeeper, ensuring only authorized users can access the content rendered by `page.tsx`.

### apps/web/app/api/AddTracks

<a id='apps-web-app-api-addtracks-route-ts'></a>

#### route.ts

*Path: apps/web/app/api/AddTracks/route.ts*

1. **Purpose:** This file defines the API endpoint `/api/AddTracks` which fetches track data from a Notion page given its ID. It's used to populate track information within the application.

2. **Key Functionality:**

- **`POST` handler:**
    - **Parameters:** `req` (NextRequest) - The incoming request object.
    - **Return Type:** `NextResponse` - The API response containing track data or an error.
    - **Implementation:**
        1. Retrieves the user's session using `getServerSession(authOptions)`.
        2. Authorizes the request, allowing access only to admin users. Returns a 401 Unauthorized response if the user is not an admin.
        3. Parses the Notion page ID (`notionId`) from the request body.
        4. Initializes a `NotionAPI` client.
        5. Fetches the Notion page data using `notion.getPage(notionId)`.
        6. Processes the `recordMap` from the Notion API response, filtering out blocks with `role: "none"`.
        7. Transforms the remaining blocks into an array of objects, each containing the `notionDocId` and `title`.
        8. Removes the first and last elements of the array (assumed to be extraneous based on the provided code).
        9. Returns the processed track data as a JSON response.
        10. Handles potential errors during the Notion API call and returns the error as a JSON response.
    - **Error Handling:** Uses a `try-catch` block to handle errors during the Notion API call.
    - **Optimizations:** Filters and maps the Notion data directly to minimize unnecessary processing.

3. **Dependencies and Relationships:**

- **Imports & Usage:**
    - `getServerSession` from `next-auth`: Used for server-side authentication.
    - `NextRequest`, `NextResponse` from `next/server`: Next.js API route handlers.
    - `NotionAPI` from `notion-client`: Used to interact with the Notion API.
    - `authOptions` from `../../../lib/auth`: Authentication configuration.
- **Code Relationships:** This file depends on the Notion API and the application's authentication mechanism. It likely interacts with other parts of the application that consume the returned track data.

4. **Usage Example:**

```javascript
// Frontend code
const response = await fetch('/api/AddTracks', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ notionId: 'YOUR_NOTION_PAGE_ID' }),
});
const tracks = await response.json();
// Use the 'tracks' data
```

5. **Technical Notes:**

- The code assumes a specific structure for the Notion page and removes the first and last elements of the processed data. This suggests a convention or template used for storing track information in Notion.
- The error handling could be more robust, providing specific error messages and status codes based on the type of error encountered.
- The authorization mechanism relies on the `admin` flag in the user's session.  This implies a role-based access control system within the application.  The `authOptions` from `../../../lib/auth` likely defines the authentication strategy and session management. The dependency on `next-auth` suggests a server-side authentication approach. This API endpoint interacts with the Notion API externally and internally with other modules that consume the track data it retrieves and processes.  This file is crucial for populating track information within the application, bridging the gap between the Notion data source and the application's internal data structures.

### apps/web/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]

<a id='apps-web-app-api-auth-[---nextauth]-route-ts'></a>

#### route.ts

*Path: apps/web/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts*

1. **Purpose:** This file sets up the NextAuth.js authentication middleware for the web application. It handles authentication routes and integrates with the authentication options defined in `authOptions`.

2. **Key Functionality:**

- **`handler`:** This constant is an instance of the NextAuth middleware initialized with `authOptions`.
    - **Parameters:** `authOptions` (object) - Configuration options for NextAuth.js, including providers, callbacks, and database adapter.
    - **Return Type:** `NextAuth` instance -  A middleware function that handles authentication requests.
    - **Implementation:** It uses the `NextAuth` function from the `next-auth` library, passing in the `authOptions` object. This sets up the authentication routes and logic based on the provided configuration.
- **`GET` and `POST` handler exports:** These lines expose the `handler` function for both GET and POST requests to the `/api/auth/*` routes. This allows NextAuth.js to handle various authentication actions like sign-in, sign-out, and callbacks.

3. **Dependencies and Relationships:**

- **Imports & Usage:**
    - `next-auth`: Provides the core NextAuth.js functionality.
    - `../../../../lib/auth`: Imports the `authOptions` object, which likely contains provider configurations (e.g., Google, GitHub), database adapter settings, and custom callbacks.
- **Code Relationships:** This file is the entry point for all authentication requests. It relies on the `authOptions` from the `lib/auth` module to configure the authentication behavior.  It interacts with external authentication providers based on the `authOptions` configuration.

4. **Usage Example:**

A user navigating to `/api/auth/signin` will trigger this route. The `handler` will process the request based on the configured providers in `authOptions`. For example, if Google is configured as a provider, the user will be redirected to Google for authentication. Upon successful authentication, the callback defined in `authOptions` will be executed.

5. **Technical Notes:**

- The `[...nextauth]` dynamic route syntax is a Next.js feature that allows NextAuth.js to handle all sub-paths under `/api/auth/`. This simplifies the routing configuration for authentication.
- The location of `authOptions` in `lib/auth` suggests a centralized configuration approach, promoting maintainability and code reusability.  This separation also keeps sensitive configuration details away from the route handler itself.
- The use of both `GET` and `POST` exports ensures that the handler can handle various authentication requests, including OAuth callbacks which might use POST.

### apps/web/app/api/revalidate

<a id='apps-web-app-api-revalidate-route-ts'></a>

#### route.ts

*Path: apps/web/app/api/revalidate/route.ts*

1. **Purpose:** This file defines an API endpoint for on-demand revalidation of Next.js cached pages. It allows external triggers to refresh specific page content, ensuring data consistency.

2. **Key Functionality:**

- **`GET(req: NextRequest)`:**
    - **Parameters:** `req` (NextRequest) - The incoming request object containing query parameters.
    - **Return Type:** `NextResponse` - The response object containing revalidation status or error information.
    - **Implementation:**
        - Retrieves the `secret` and `path` from the request query parameters.
        - Validates the `secret` against the environment variable `MY_SECRET_TOKEN`.
        - If the secret is valid and a `path` is provided, it calls `revalidatePath(path)` to trigger revalidation of the specified path.
        - Returns a JSON response indicating success or failure.
    - **Error Handling:** Returns a 401 error for invalid tokens and a 500 error for revalidation failures.

3. **Dependencies and Relationships:**

- **Imports & Usage:**
    - `next/cache`: Imports `revalidatePath` for interacting with Next.js's caching mechanism.
    - `next/server`: Imports `NextRequest` and `NextResponse` for handling requests and responses in a Next.js API route.
- **Code Relationships:** This API endpoint is likely triggered by external systems (e.g., CMS webhooks) or internal processes that need to refresh specific pages after data updates.  It directly interacts with the Next.js runtime to invalidate the cache.

4. **Usage Example:**

```bash
# Trigger revalidation of the '/products' page
curl -X GET "https://your-domain/api/revalidate?secret=YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN&path=/products"
```

5. **Technical Notes:**

- **Security:** The `MY_SECRET_TOKEN` environment variable is crucial for securing this endpoint.  Without proper validation, anyone could trigger revalidation, potentially leading to performance issues or unintended cache invalidation.
- **Performance:**  On-demand revalidation offers granular control over cache refresh, improving performance compared to time-based invalidation, especially for infrequently updated content.  However, excessive revalidation calls can negatively impact performance.
- **Edge Cases:** The code handles missing `path` parameters gracefully, but it might be beneficial to log invalid revalidation requests for debugging and security analysis.  Consider adding rate limiting to prevent abuse.

### apps/web/app/auth

<a id='apps-web-app-auth-page-tsx'></a>

#### page.tsx

*Path: apps/web/app/auth/page.tsx*

1. **Purpose:** This file defines the `SigninPage` component, which renders the sign-in form for the web application. It serves as the entry point for user authentication.

2. **Key Functionality:**

- **`SigninPage` (functional component):**
    - **Parameters:** None
    - **Return Type:** `JSX.Element` (React component)
    - **Implementation:** This component uses React's `Suspense` component to handle the asynchronous loading of the `Signin` component. This improves the perceived performance by displaying a fallback UI while the `Signin` component is being loaded.
- **`Signin` (imported component):**  This component is assumed to contain the actual sign-in form logic and UI elements.  Its specific implementation details are not available in this file.

3. **Dependencies and Relationships:**

- **Imports & Usage:**
    - `react`:  Uses `Suspense` for asynchronous component loading.
    - `../../components/Signin`: Imports the `Signin` component, which encapsulates the sign-in form.
- **Code Relationships:** This file is the entry point for the `/auth` route (implied). It depends on the `Signin` component for the actual sign-in functionality.

4. **Usage Example:**

This component would be rendered when a user navigates to the `/auth` route of the application.  The Next.js router (implied) would match this route to this file and render the `SigninPage` component.

5. **Technical Notes:**

- The use of `Suspense` suggests that the `Signin` component might involve dynamic imports or other asynchronous operations, potentially for code splitting or lazy loading. This optimization can improve initial page load performance.

### apps/web/app/canva-track/[...trackIds]

<a id='apps-web-app-canva-track-[---trackids]-page-tsx'></a>

#### page.tsx

*Path: apps/web/app/canva-track/[...trackIds]/page.tsx*

1. **Purpose:** This file renders a Canva presentation embedded within an iframe. It retrieves the Canva link and title from URL parameters and displays the presentation in a full-screen view.

2. **Key Functionality:**

- **`Header` Component:**
    - Parameters: `title` (string) - The title of the Canva presentation.
    - Return Type: `React.ReactElement` - Renders the header section of the page.
    - Implementation:  Displays the provided title and a link back to the home page with an image. Uses `motion.div` from `framer-motion` for animation effects.

- **`CanvaTrack` Component (default export):**
    - Parameters: None
    - Return Type: `React.ReactElement` - Renders the entire page containing the embedded Canva presentation.
    - Implementation:
        - Uses `useSearchParams` from `next/navigation` to retrieve URL parameters (`canvaLink`, `title`).
        - Constructs the `embedUrl` by appending `?embed` to the `canvaLink` if it's not already present.
        - Renders a full-screen iframe with the `embedUrl` as its source, allowing fullscreen viewing.
        - Includes error handling: If `embedUrl` is missing, it displays a "No Canva presentation link provided" message.

3. **Dependencies and Relationships:**

- **Imports & Usage:**
    - `React`: Core React library.
    - `useSearchParams` (from `next/navigation`): For accessing URL query parameters.
    - `motion` (from `framer-motion`): For animation effects.
    - `Link` (from `next/link`): For client-side navigation.
    - `Image` (from `next/image`): For optimized image rendering.

- **Code Relationships:** This file is a standalone page component within a Next.js application. It likely interacts with other parts of the application through routing and potentially shared context or data fetching mechanisms (not shown in this file).

4. **Usage Example:**

Navigating to a URL like `/canva-track/123?canvaLink=https://www.canva.com/design/DAFadsf/view&title=My%20Presentation` would render this page with the specified Canva presentation embedded. The `[...trackIds]` dynamic route segment suggests that this page might handle multiple Canva presentations based on IDs, although this specific implementation only uses the query parameters.

5. **Technical Notes:**

- The use of `?embed` ensures that the Canva presentation is displayed in embed mode within the iframe.
- The `allowFullScreen` and `allow="fullscreen"` attributes enable fullscreen viewing of the embedded presentation.
- The conditional rendering based on `embedUrl` provides a basic error handling mechanism.
- The use of `framer-motion` adds subtle animations to the header, enhancing the user experience.  The specific animation configuration (duration, ease, type, damping) could be adjusted for different effects.
- The `Image` component from `next/image` is used for optimized image loading and responsiveness.  It's important to provide appropriate `width` and `height` props for optimal performance.


This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the file's purpose, functionality, dependencies, and usage. It highlights key implementation details, error handling, and technical considerations, offering valuable insights into how this component integrates within a larger Next.js application.

1. **Purpose:** This file defines a dynamic route handler for rendering a printable lesson view based on a track ID and problem ID. It fetches data from a Notion API and renders the content using Next.js components.

2. **Key Functionality:**

- **`TrackComponent({ params })`:**
    - **Parameters:** `params`: An object containing the dynamic route parameters.  `params.pdfId` is an array where `pdfId[0]` is the `trackId` and `pdfId[1]` is the `problemId`.
    - **Return Type:** JSX.Element (React component)
    - **Implementation:**
        - Extracts `trackId` and `problemId` from `params`.
        - Redirects to a specific track if `trackId` matches a hardcoded value.
        - Fetches problem and track details using `getProblem` and `getTrack`.
        - If no `problemId` is provided, redirects to the last solved problem using `RedirectToLastSolved`.
        - Fetches Notion page data for the problem and all problems in the track using `notion.getPage`.  This fetches data for all problems in the track to allow printing of the entire track.
        - Redirects to the login page if the user is not authenticated, preserving the intended download URL.
        - Renders `LessonView` components for each problem in the track, passing the fetched data.
        - Includes a `Print` component for printing functionality.
    - **Fallback Mechanisms:** Redirects to login if no session exists. Handles missing `problemId` by redirecting to the last solved problem.

- **Dependencies:**
    - `RedirectToLastSolved`: Internal component for redirecting to the last solved problem.
    - `NotionAPI`: External library for interacting with the Notion API.
    - `redirect`: Next.js function for redirecting navigation.
    - `Print`: Internal component for printing functionality.
    - `getProblem`, `getTrack`: Internal utility functions for fetching problem and track details.
    - `LessonView`: Internal component for displaying lesson content.
    - `getServerSession`: NextAuth function for retrieving the server-side session.
    - `authOptions`: NextAuth configuration options.

3. **Dependencies and Relationships:**

- **Imports & Usage:** Imports components, utility functions, and external libraries as described above.
- **Code Relationships:** This file depends on the `getProblem` and `getTrack` functions to fetch data. It uses the `LessonView` component to display the lesson content and the `Print` component for printing. It interacts with the authentication system through `getServerSession` and `authOptions`.

4. **Usage Example:** Accessing the URL `/pdf/some-track-id/some-problem-id` will trigger this route handler.

5. **Technical Notes:**

- The code fetches Notion data for all problems in the track, even though only one problem is initially displayed. This is likely done to enable printing of the entire track at once.  This could be optimized to fetch data on demand if performance becomes an issue.
- The hardcoded redirect for a specific `trackId` suggests a potential temporary workaround or a special case that needs to be addressed more systematically.
- The use of `Promise.all` for fetching Notion pages optimizes performance by fetching data concurrently.

*Path: apps/web/app/profile/layout.tsx*

1. **Purpose:** This file defines the layout for the user profile page in a Next.js web application. It structures the profile section with a sidebar and content area.

2. **Key Functionality:**

- **`ProfileLayout` Function:**
    - **Parameters:** `children: React.ReactNode` (The content to be rendered within the layout)
    - **Return Type:** `JSX.Element` (The rendered layout component)
    - **Implementation:** This function uses a grid layout to arrange the `ProfileSidebar` and `ProfileChilldren` components. It wraps the provided `children` within the `ProfileChilldren` component, placing it in the main content area.  The `AppbarClient` component is rendered at the top.
    - **Fallback Mechanisms:**  No specific fallback mechanisms are implemented within this layout component. Error handling would be handled by parent components or error boundaries higher up in the component tree.

- **`metadata` Constant:**
    - **Type:** `Metadata` (Next.js metadata object)
    - **Implementation:** Defines metadata for the page, including the title and description for SEO purposes.

3. **Dependencies and Relationships:**

- **Imports & Usage:**
    - `Metadata` from `next`: Used for defining page metadata.
    - `AppbarClient` from `../../components/AppbarClient`: The application's app bar component.
    - `ProfileSidebar` from `../../components/ProfileSidebar`: The sidebar component for the profile page.
    - `ProfileChilldren` from `../../components/ProfileChildren`: A wrapper component for the dynamic content within the profile section.

- **Code Relationships:** This layout is used by the `page.tsx` file within the same directory to structure the profile page content.  It relies on the `AppbarClient`, `ProfileSidebar`, and `ProfileChildren` components.

4. **Usage Example:**

```tsx
// In page.tsx
import ProfileLayout from './layout';

export default function ProfilePage() {
  return (
    <ProfileLayout>
      {/* Content specific to the profile page */}
      <div>Profile content here</div>
    </ProfileLayout>
  );
}
```

5. **Technical Notes:**

- The use of a grid layout (`grid grid-cols-8`) provides a responsive structure for the profile page.
- The `ProfileChildren` component acts as a container for the dynamic content passed as children, ensuring consistent styling and positioning within the layout.

<a id='apps-web-app-profile-page-tsx'></a>

#### page.tsx

*Path: apps/web/app/profile/page.tsx*

1. **Purpose:** This file defines the main content and logic for the user profile page. It handles authentication and renders the user's profile details.

2. **Key Functionality:**

- **`Profile` Function:**
    - **Return Type:** `JSX.Element` (The rendered profile page component)
    - **Implementation:** This function first checks for an active user session using `getServerSession`. If no session exists, it redirects the user to the authentication page (`/auth`). If a session exists, it renders the profile page content, including a header and the `UserDetailForm` component.
    - **Fallback Mechanisms:** Redirects to `/auth` if no user session is found.

3. **Dependencies and Relationships:**

- **Imports & Usage:**
    - `getServerSession` from `next-auth`: Used for server-side authentication.
    - `authOptions` from `../../lib/auth`: Authentication configuration.
    - `redirect` from `next/navigation`: Used for client-side navigation.
    - `UserRound` from `lucide-react`: Icon component.
    - `UserDetailForm` from `../../components/UserDetailForm`: Component for displaying and editing user details.

- **Code Relationships:** This page uses the `ProfileLayout` component from `layout.tsx` to structure its content. It depends on the `next-auth` library for authentication and utilizes the `UserDetailForm` component to display user details.

4. **Usage Example:** This file represents a page route in the Next.js application and is accessed via the `/profile` URL.

5. **Technical Notes:**

- Server-side authentication ensures that sensitive user data is not exposed on the client-side.
- The use of `redirect` provides a seamless client-side transition to the login page if the user is not authenticated.
- This file depends on the `layout.tsx` file for its overall structure and layout.  The `UserDetailForm` component, used within this page, likely receives the user data from the `session.user` object to pre-fill the form fields.  This demonstrates a clear flow of data and dependencies between the files within the profile section of the application.

### apps/web/app/tracks/[...trackIds]

<a id='apps-web-app-tracks-[---trackids]-page-tsx'></a>

#### page.tsx

*Path: apps/web/app/tracks/[...trackIds]/page.tsx*

1. **Purpose:** This file defines a dynamic Next.js page component responsible for rendering individual lesson pages within a learning track. It fetches track and problem details and displays them using a `LessonView` component.

2. **Key Functionality:**

- **`generateMetadata({ params })`**: This asynchronous function generates dynamic metadata for the page based on the track ID.  It fetches track details using `getTrack(trackId)` and returns an object containing the title, description, and open graph metadata.  If the track is not found, it returns default metadata indicating a 404.
    - **Parameters:** `params`: An object containing the route parameters, including `trackIds`.
    - **Return Type:** An object containing metadata for the page.
- **`generateStaticParams()`**: This asynchronous function generates static parameters for pre-rendering. It fetches all tracks and their associated problems using `getAllTracks()` and `cache` (for memoization). It returns an array of objects, each representing a page to be pre-rendered.  Error handling is included with a console log and an empty array return.
    - **Return Type:** An array of objects representing static paths.
- **`TrackComponent({ params })`**: This is the main page component. It retrieves the `trackId` and `problemId` from the route parameters. It handles redirection for a specific track ID. It fetches problem and track details using `getProblem()` and `getTrack()`. If no `problemId` is provided, it redirects to the last solved problem in the track using `RedirectToLastSolved`. If a `notionDocId` exists for the problem, it fetches the Notion page content using `notion.getPage()`. Finally, it renders the `LessonView` component with the fetched data or returns a 404 if the data is not found.
    - **Parameters:** `params`: An object containing the route parameters.
    - **Return Type:** JSX to be rendered.

3. **Dependencies and Relationships:**

- **Imports & Usage:**
    - `RedirectToLastSolved`: Internal component for redirecting to the last solved problem.
    - `NotionAPI` from `notion-client`: Used for fetching data from Notion.
    - `redirect`, `notFound` from `next/navigation`: Next.js routing functions.
    - `getAllTracks`, `getProblem`, `getTrack`: Internal utility functions for data fetching.
    - `cache` from `react`: For memoizing the `getAllTracks` function.
    - `LessonView`: Internal component for rendering the lesson content.
- **Code Relationships:**
    - This file depends on the `components/utils.ts` file for data fetching functions (`getAllTracks`, `getProblem`, `getTrack`).
    - It uses the `components/RedirectToLastSolved` component for handling redirection logic.
    - It uses the `components/LessonView` component to display the lesson content.

4. **Usage Example:**

Navigating to `/tracks/some-track-id/some-problem-id` will render this page component.  Next.js will use the `generateStaticParams` and `generateMetadata` functions at build time for pre-rendering and SEO.

5. **Technical Notes:**

- The use of `cache` around `getAllTracks` improves performance by memoizing the results.
- The fallback to a default thumbnail image in `generateMetadata` enhances robustness.
- The redirection logic for a specific track ID (`43XrfL4n0LgSnTkSB4rO`) suggests a potential migration or alias.
- The dynamic route `[...trackIds]` allows for flexible handling of both track and problem IDs within the URL.  The code handles cases where only the `trackId` is present.

4.  **Usage Example:**

    ```tsx
    <NotionRenderer recordMap={pageData.recordMap} />
    ```

5.  **Technical Notes:**
    -   The conditional styling based on `isLegacyMode` suggests a transition phase between two rendering approaches.
    -   The `useMemo` hook optimizes the `components` prop, preventing unnecessary re-renders.

The MCQ functionality is modularized into several components, promoting reusability and maintainability.  `MCQRenderer` acts as the main container, orchestrating the layout and integrating the other components.  `MCQPanel` handles the description and submission history, while `MCQCard` manages the display and interaction with the questions themselves.  `MCQQuestion` renders individual questions, and `EditMCQ` provides editing capabilities.  Utility functions in `../utils` handle database interactions.  The system leverages Next.js features like client components and server sessions.  Dependencies on external libraries like `@repo/ui`, `next-auth/react`, and `@prisma/client` are clearly defined.  The components communicate primarily through props and callbacks.  Error handling and data validation are distributed across components and utility functions.  The use of a resizable panel in `MCQRenderer` enhances user experience.  The system is designed to be scalable and maintainable, adhering to best practices for React development.

### apps/web/components/privacy-policy

<a id='apps-web-components-privacy-policy-privacy-policy-ts'></a>

#### privacy-policy.ts

*Path: apps/web/components/privacy-policy/privacy-policy.ts*

1. **Purpose:** This file defines the privacy policy content displayed on the website. It stores the policy as an array of objects, each containing a segment of the policy text.

2. **Key Functionality:**

- **`privacyPolicyContent`:**  This constant array holds the privacy policy text. Each element in the array is an object with two properties:
    - `id`: (number) A unique identifier for each section of the privacy policy.
    - `description`: (string) The text content of the privacy policy section.

    The implementation is straightforward: a hardcoded array of objects.  No functions or methods are present.

3. **Dependencies and Relationships:**

- **Imports & Usage:** This file has no external dependencies.
- **Code Relationships:** This file is likely imported by a component that renders the privacy policy on the website. The component would iterate through the `privacyPolicyContent` array and display each `description`.

4. **Usage Example:**

```typescript
// Example usage in a React component
import { privacyPolicyContent } from './privacy-policy';

const PrivacyPolicyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      {privacyPolicyContent.map((section) => (
        <p key={section.id}>{section.description}</p>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};
```

5. **Technical Notes:**

- The privacy policy is hardcoded.  For maintainability, consider storing this content in a separate file (e.g., a markdown file or a database) and loading it dynamically. This would allow updating the policy without recompiling the application.  This also opens possibilities for internationalization.
- The `id` field, while currently unused in the provided code, suggests potential future enhancements like linking to specific sections or implementing dynamic show/hide features.

### apps/web/components/profile

<a id='apps-web-components-profile-profileoptions-tsx'></a>

#### ProfileOptions.tsx

*Path: apps/web/components/profile/ProfileOptions.tsx*

1. **Purpose:** This React component renders a list of profile options (e.g., "Profile", "Submissions") with icons, allowing users to navigate between different sections of their profile. It highlights the currently active option based on the URL.

2. **Key Functionality:**

- **`ProfileOptions` (functional component):**
    - **Parameters:** None
    - **Return Type:** `JSX.Element` (React component)
    - **Implementation:**  Renders a vertical list of profile options.  Uses `usePathname` from `next/navigation` to get the current URL path and `useRouter` to handle navigation.  The `useEffect` hook updates the active option whenever the pathname changes.  The `handleOptionClick` function updates the active state and navigates to the selected option's URL.
    - **Fallback Mechanisms:** No explicit fallback mechanisms are implemented. If the pathname doesn't match any option, none will be highlighted.

- **`optionsData` (array):**
    - Contains the configuration for each profile option, including its name, icon (using `lucide-react`), and associated URL.

- **`useState` (hook):** Manages the `activeOption` state, which tracks the currently selected option's index. Initialized based on the initial pathname.

- **`useEffect` (hook):** Synchronizes the `activeOption` state with the current `pathname`.

- **`handleOptionClick` (function):**
    - **Parameters:** `index` (number), `href` (string)
    - **Return Type:** `void`
    - **Implementation:** Called when an option is clicked. Updates the `activeOption` state and uses the `router.push` method to navigate to the corresponding `href`.

3. **Dependencies and Relationships:**

- **Imports & Usage:**
    - `lucide-react`: Used for displaying icons.
    - `next/navigation`:  `usePathname` and `useRouter` are used for routing and determining the active section.
    - `react`: Core React library for functional components, hooks, and JSX.

- **Code Relationships:** This component is likely used within a larger profile page layout component. It relies on the Next.js routing system for navigation.

4. **Usage Example:**

```jsx
// Within a parent profile layout component
<ProfileOptions />
```

This component would typically be placed within a sidebar or navigation section of a user's profile page.  The parent component would handle fetching and displaying the main profile content based on the active option selected through this component.

5. **Technical Notes:**

- The component uses client-side routing provided by `next/navigation`.
- The initial active option is determined on the client-side using the `useState` hook with a functional initializer. This ensures the correct option is highlighted on the initial render.
- Styling is applied using Tailwind CSS classes.
- No specific error handling is implemented as the component primarily relies on Next.js routing, which handles navigation errors.  More robust error handling might be needed if the `optionsData` were fetched dynamically.

### apps/web/components/tnc

<a id='apps-web-components-tnc-tnc-content-ts'></a>

#### tnc-content.ts

*Path: apps/web/components/tnc/tnc-content.ts*

1. **Purpose:** This file defines the terms and conditions content displayed on the 100xDevs website. It stores the content as a structured JavaScript array of objects, making it easy to manage and render in a component.

2. **Key Functionality:**

- **`tncContent` (constant):**  This constant array holds the terms and conditions data. Each element in the array represents a section or paragraph of the T&C.  The structure is as follows:
    - `id` (number): A unique identifier for the section.
    - `description` (string): The text content of the section.
    - `points` (array, optional):  An array of sub-points within a section. Each point has an `id` (number) and a `description` (string).

    The code simply defines the data structure. There's no complex logic or implementation details.

3. **Dependencies and Relationships:**

- **Imports & Usage:** This file has no external dependencies.
- **Code Relationships:** This file is likely imported and used by a React component responsible for displaying the terms and conditions on the website. The component would iterate through the `tncContent` array and render the `description` and `points` accordingly.

4. **Usage Example:**

```typescript
// Example usage in a React component (hypothetical)
import { tncContent } from './tnc-content';

const TermsAndConditions: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      {tncContent.map((section) => (
        <div key={section.id}>
          <p>{section.description}</p>
          {section.points && (
            <ul>
              {section.points.map((point) => (
                <li key={point.id}>{point.description}</li>
              ))}
            </ul>
          )}
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};

export default TermsAndConditions;

```

5. **Technical Notes:**

- The data is hardcoded within the component. For larger or more dynamic T&C content, consider fetching the data from an external source (e.g., a CMS or database) to improve maintainability and allow for easier updates without code changes.  This would also allow for internationalization.
- The current structure uses numerical IDs.  While functional, using unique string IDs (UUIDs) is generally recommended for better scalability and flexibility, especially if the data will be managed externally.
- No specific error handling is needed in this file as it only defines data. Error handling (e.g., for fetching data if moved to an external source) would be implemented in the component that uses this data.

---

### apps/web/hooks

<a id='apps-web-hooks-usemountstatus-ts'></a>

#### useMountStatus.ts

*Path: apps/web/hooks/useMountStatus.ts*

1. **Purpose:** This file provides a React Hook, `useMountStatus`, which tracks the mount status of a component. It allows other components to determine if they are currently mounted in the DOM.

2. **Key Functionality:**

- **`useMountStatus()`:**
    - Parameters: None
    - Return Type: `boolean` (true if mounted, false otherwise)
    - Technical Explanation: This hook uses the `useState` hook to manage the `mounted` state variable.  Initially set to `false`, the `useEffect` hook with an empty dependency array ensures that `setMounted(true)` is called only once after the initial render, effectively indicating that the component is mounted.

3. **Dependencies and Relationships:**

- **Imports & Usage:** This hook depends on React's core libraries (`react`) for `useEffect` and `useState`.
- **Code Relationships:** This hook is typically used within other React components to manage logic that should only execute when the component is mounted, preventing potential errors or memory leaks caused by state updates or DOM manipulations after a component has unmounted.

4. **Usage Example:**

```typescript
import useMountStatus from './useMountStatus';

const MyComponent: React.FC = () => {
  const isMounted = useMountStatus();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (isMounted) {
      // Perform actions that require the component to be mounted,
      // such as subscribing to an event listener or fetching data.
    }

    return () => {
      // Cleanup logic if necessary (e.g., unsubscribe from event listeners)
    };
  }, [isMounted]);

  return <div>My Component</div>;
};
```

5. **Technical Notes:**

- The empty dependency array in `useEffect` ensures the callback runs only once after the initial render, mimicking componentDidMount lifecycle behavior in class components. This is crucial for preventing unintended side effects or memory leaks.  This hook provides a clean and efficient way to handle mount-related logic in functional components.

---

### apps/web/lib

<a id='apps-web-lib-auth-ts'></a>

#### auth.ts

*Path: apps/web/lib/auth.ts*

1. **Purpose:** This file configures authentication using NextAuth.js, integrating with GitHub and Google providers and using Prisma for database persistence. It also implements a rate limiting mechanism.

2. **Key Functionality:**

- **`authOptions` (object):** Configuration object for NextAuth.js.
    - `adapter: PrismaAdapter(db)`: Uses Prisma to manage user data.
    - `providers: [GithubProvider, GoogleProvider]` : Sets up authentication with GitHub and Google.  Each provider requires `clientId` and `clientSecret` from environment variables. `allowDangerousEmailAccountLinking` is enabled (consider security implications).
    - `secret`: Secret used to encrypt JWTs (should be a strong, randomly generated string).
    - `pages`: Customizes sign-in page URL.
    - `session`: Defines session strategy as JWT.
    - `callbacks`: Contains functions to modify the JWT and session objects.
        - `jwt({ token })`:  Returns the token.
        - `session({ session, token })`: Enriches the session object with user data from the database, including the `accessToken` and a custom `admin` flag.  Retrieves user data based on `token.sub` (user ID).
- **`rateLimit(userId, rateLimitCount, rateLimitInterval)` (function):** Implements rate limiting for a given user.
    - `userId (string)`: The ID of the user to rate limit.
    - `rateLimitCount (number)`: The maximum number of requests allowed within the interval.
    - `rateLimitInterval (number)`: The time interval (in milliseconds) for the rate limit.
    - Returns `true` if the request is allowed, `false` otherwise.
    - Implementation: Uses a `Map` to store user timestamps.  Removes outdated timestamps based on `rateLimitInterval`.  If the number of remaining timestamps exceeds `rateLimitCount`, returns `false`.

3. **Dependencies and Relationships:**

- **Imports & Usage:**
    - `next-auth`:  Provides authentication functionalities.
    - `next-auth/providers/{github, google}`:  Providers for GitHub and Google authentication.
    - `@auth/prisma-adapter`:  Adapter for using Prisma with NextAuth.js.
    - `@repo/db/client`:  Prisma client instance.
- **Code Relationships:** This file is used by the NextAuth.js middleware to handle authentication.

4. **Usage Example:**  This configuration is used within the `[...nextauth].ts` file in the `pages/api` directory, which is the default NextAuth.js endpoint.

5. **Technical Notes:**
    - The `allowDangerousEmailAccountLinking` flag in the providers should be carefully considered as it poses security risks.
    - The `secret` should be a strong, randomly generated value stored securely.
    - The rate limiting mechanism is in-memory and won't scale across multiple server instances. Consider using a distributed cache like Redis for production.

*Path: apps/web/lib/cache/in-memory-cache.ts*

1. **Purpose:** This file implements the `ICache` interface using an in-memory map, providing a simple caching solution within the application's process.

2. **Key Functionality:**

- **Class `InMemoryCache`:** Implements the `ICache` interface.
    - **`constructor()`:** Initializes the `inMemoryDb` as a `Map`.
    - **`static getInstance()`:** Implements the Singleton pattern, ensuring only one instance of `InMemoryCache` exists.
    - **`set(type: string, args: string[], value: any, expirySeconds: number)`:**  Sets a cache entry with an expiry time. Uses `generateKey` to create a unique key. Default expiry is fetched from the `CACHE_EXPIRE` environment variable or defaults to 1800 seconds (30 minutes).
    - **`get(type: string, args: string[]): Promise<any>`:** Retrieves a cached value.  Handles expired entries by removing them and returning `null`.
    - **`evict(type: string, args: string[]): Promise<null>`:** Removes a cache entry.
    - **`private generateKey(type: string, args: string[]): string`:** Creates a cache key from the `type` and `args`.

3. **Dependencies and Relationships:**

- **Imports:** `ICache` from `./cache.ts`.
- **Relationships:** Implements the `ICache` interface, fulfilling the contract defined in `cache.ts`.

4. **Usage Example:**

```typescript
import { InMemoryCache } from './in-memory-cache';

const cache = InMemoryCache.getInstance();
await cache.set('product', ['123'], { name: 'Awesome Product' });
const product = await cache.get('product', ['123']);
```

5. **Technical Notes:**

- The Singleton pattern ensures that only one in-memory cache exists, preventing data inconsistencies.
- The default expiry time is configurable via the `CACHE_EXPIRE` environment variable.

2. **Key Functionality:**

- **Class `RedisCache`:** Implements the `ICache` interface.
    - **`constructor(redisUrl: string)`:** Initializes a Redis client using the provided `redisUrl`.
    - **`static getInstance(redisUrl: string)`:** Implements the Singleton pattern, ensuring only one instance of `RedisCache` exists per provided URL.
    - **`set(type: string, args: string[], value: any, expirySeconds: number)`:** Sets a value in Redis with an optional expiry.  Uses `generateKey` to create a unique key. Serializes the `value` using `JSON.stringify`.
    - **`get(type: string, args: string[]): Promise<any>`:** Retrieves a value from Redis. Deserializes the value using `JSON.parse`.
    - **`evict(type: string, args: string[]): Promise<null>`:** Deletes a key from Redis.
    - **`private generateKey(type: string, args: string[]): string`:** Creates a cache key from the `type` and `args`.

3. **Dependencies and Relationships:**

- **Imports:** `Redis` from `ioredis`, `ICache` from `./cache.ts`.
- **Relationships:** Implements the `ICache` interface, fulfilling the contract defined in `cache.ts`.  Uses the `ioredis` library to interact with a Redis instance.

4. **Usage Example:**

```typescript
import { RedisCache } from './redis-cache';

const cache = RedisCache.getInstance(process.env.REDIS_URL);
await cache.set('user', ['456'], { name: 'Jane Doe' }, 7200);
const user = await cache.get('user', ['456']);
```

5. **Technical Notes:**

- The Singleton pattern ensures only one Redis client is created per Redis URL, optimizing resource usage.
- Uses `JSON.stringify` and `JSON.parse` for serialization and deserialization, making it compatible with various data types.


These three files work together to provide a flexible caching system.  `cache.ts` defines the interface, while `in-memory-cache.ts` and `redis-cache.ts` provide concrete implementations. This allows the application to easily switch between in-memory and Redis caching based on configuration or deployment environment.  The use of a shared interface ensures consistent interaction regardless of the chosen implementation.

- **`Admin` (functional component):**
    - **Parameters:** None
    - **Return Type:** `JSX.Element` (React component)
    - **Implementation:** Fetches data for problems, tracks, and categories using `getAllProblems`, `getAllTracks`, and `getCategories` respectively.  It also fetches tracks based on their `inSearch` status from the database using Prisma Client queries.  Renders a tabbed interface using the `Tabs` component from `@repo/ui`. Each tab provides specific admin functionality: managing complete tracks, problems, tracks, linking problems to tracks, managing search indexing, and MCQ functionality. The component leverages asynchronous operations for data fetching and displays a notification about the need for manual refresh to see changes reflected in the admin interface.
    - **Fallback Mechanisms:**  While there isn't explicit error handling shown, the asynchronous fetches should ideally be wrapped in `try...catch` blocks to handle potential network or database errors gracefully.

3. **Dependencies and Relationships:**

- **Imports & Usage:**
    - `@repo/ui`:  Uses components like `Tabs`, `TabsContent`, `TabsList`, and `TabsTrigger` for the tabbed interface.
    - `../components/admin/*`: Imports various admin-related components for each tab's content.
    - `../components/utils`: Imports utility functions `getAllProblems`, `getAllTracks`, and `getCategories` for data fetching.

### packages/db

<a id='packages-db-cache-ts'></a>

#### Cache.ts

*Path: packages/db/Cache.ts*

1. **Purpose:** This file defines a `Cache` class that provides a unified interface for caching data, abstracting the underlying implementation (in-memory or Redis). It uses a singleton pattern to ensure only one instance of the cache exists.

2. **Key Functionality:**

- **`Cache` class:** Implements the `ICache` interface.  Uses a strategy pattern to delegate to either `InMemoryCache` or `RedisCache`.
    - **`constructor()`:** Private constructor to enforce singleton pattern. Initializes the `delegate` based on the presence of `REDIS_URL` environment variable.
    - **`getInstance()`:** Static method that returns the singleton instance of `Cache`. Creates the instance if it doesn't exist.
    - **`set(type: string, args: string[], value: any, expirySeconds: number)`:**  Sets a cached value.
        - `type`:  A string representing the type of data being cached (e.g., "user").
        - `args`: An array of strings used to create a unique cache key (e.g., ["123"]).
        - `value`: The value to be cached.
        - `expirySeconds`:  The time-to-live (TTL) for the cached entry. Defaults to 1800 seconds (30 minutes).
        - Returns: `Promise<void>`.
        - Implementation: Delegates the `set` operation to the underlying `delegate` (either `InMemoryCache` or `RedisCache`).
    - **`get(type: string, args: string[])`:** Retrieves a cached value.
        - `type`: The type of data.
        - `args`: The arguments used to create the cache key.
        - Returns: `Promise<any>`. The cached value or `null` if not found.
        - Implementation: Delegates the `get` operation to the underlying `delegate`.
    - **`evict(type: string, args: string[])`:** Removes a cached entry.
        - `type`: The type of data.
        - `args`: The arguments used to create the cache key.
        - Returns: `Promise<null>`.
        - Implementation: Delegates the `evict` operation to the underlying `delegate`.

- **`cache` constant:**  An instance of the `Cache` class, readily available for use.

3. **Dependencies and Relationships:**

- **Imports & Usage:**
    - `ICache`: Interface defining the cache methods.
    - `InMemoryCache`: In-memory caching implementation.
    - `RedisCache`: Redis-based caching implementation.
- **Code Relationships:** This file is the central point of access for caching throughout the application.  Other modules interact with this file to utilize caching functionality.  It depends on the `InMemoryCache` and `RedisCache` modules for the actual caching implementation.

4. **Usage Example:**

```typescript
import { cache } from './Cache';

async function getUser(id: string) {
  const cachedUser = await cache.get('user', [id]);
  if (cachedUser) {
    return cachedUser;
  }

  // Fetch user from database
  const user = await fetchUserFromDatabase(id);

  await cache.set('user', [id], user);
  return user;
}
```

5. **Technical Notes:**

- The use of the singleton pattern ensures that only one cache instance exists, preventing potential inconsistencies and resource wastage.
- The strategy pattern allows for easy switching between different caching implementations without modifying the consuming code.
- The `REDIS_URL` environment variable controls which caching implementation is used.  If it's set, Redis is used; otherwise, the in-memory cache is used.

<a id='packages-db-setupdb-sh'></a>

#### setupDB.sh

*Path: packages/db/setupDB.sh*

1. **Purpose:** This shell script sets up the database for the application. It handles both local (Postgres or Docker) and cloud database setups, including migrations and seeding.

2. **Key Functionality:**

- **`migrate_seed_db()` function:**  Handles database migrations and seeding.  Checks if seeds have already been applied and skips seeding if they have.
- **Environment Variable Handling:** Checks for the existence of a `.env` file and copies `.env.example` if it doesn't exist.
- **Database Type Selection:** Prompts the user to choose between local and cloud database setups.
- **Local Database Setup:**
    - Prompts for Postgres or Docker setup.
    - If Postgres, prompts for database credentials.
    - If Docker, sets up the `DATABASE_URL` for the Docker container.
- **Cloud Database Setup:** Prompts for the cloud database URI.
- **Docker Container Management:** Starts the Docker container if Docker is chosen and handles potential errors.
- **Migration and Seeding:** Calls the `migrate_seed_db` function to apply migrations and seed the database.

3. **Dependencies and Relationships:**

- **Dependencies:**  `docker-compose`, `npx`, `prisma`.
- **Code Relationships:** This script is typically run during the application setup process. It interacts with the database (either local or cloud) and uses `prisma` for migrations and seeding.  It sets the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable, which is used by `Cache.ts` (File 1) to determine the database connection for caching.

4. **Usage Example:**

```bash
./setupDB.sh
```

5. **Technical Notes:**

- The script uses a series of prompts to guide the user through the setup process.
- Error handling is implemented for the Docker setup to ensure the container is running.
- The `migrate_seed_db` function prevents duplicate seeding.
- The script modifies the `.env` file, which is crucial for the application's database connection.


**Inter-file Relationships:**

- `setupDB.sh` (File 2) sets the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.  This variable is used by `Cache.ts` (File 1) to determine whether to use Redis or in-memory caching. If `REDIS_URL` is set (indicating a likely cloud deployment where `setupDB.sh` would have configured a cloud database), Redis is used. Otherwise, in-memory caching is used, which is more suitable for local development setups where `setupDB.sh` might have configured a local Postgres or Docker database. This demonstrates a clear dependency and interaction between these two files, mediated by environment variables.  This setup allows for flexible configuration based on the deployment environment.

### packages/db/prisma

<a id='packages-db-prisma-seed-ts'></a>

#### seed.ts

*Path: packages/db/prisma/seed.ts*

1. **Purpose:** This file seeds the database with initial data for tracks and categories, establishing relationships between them. It's essential for setting up a development or testing environment with predefined data.

2. **Key Functionality:**

- **`main()`:** This asynchronous function orchestrates the seeding process.
    - Parameters: None
    - Return Type: `Promise<void>`
    - Implementation:
        - Iterates through `seedsData` (imported from `./seedsData`).
        - Uses a `hashID` array to prevent duplicate track entries.
        - Checks if a track with the given ID already exists using `db.track.findUnique`.
        - Creates a new track using `db.track.create` if it doesn't exist.
        - Creates predefined categories using `db.categories.create`.
        - Creates relationships between tracks and categories using `db.trackCategory.createMany`.
        - Includes error handling with a `try...catch` block to log potential errors during track creation.
- **Fallback Mechanisms:** The `try...catch` block around the database operations catches and logs errors, preventing the seeding process from halting completely if a single operation fails.  However, it doesn't implement retries or other sophisticated error recovery mechanisms.

3. **Dependencies and Relationships:**

- **Imports & Usage:**
    - `db` from `../src`:  Imports the Prisma client instance, which is used to interact with the database.
    - `seedsData` from `./seedsData`: Imports the seed data for tracks.
- **Code Relationships:** This file depends on the database schema defined in the Prisma schema file (likely `schema.prisma` in the same directory) and uses the Prisma client to interact with the database.  It also relies on the `seedsData` file for the initial track data.

4. **Usage Example:** This script is typically executed during development or testing setup using a command like `npx prisma db seed`.  It populates the database with the initial data required for the application to function correctly.

5. **Technical Notes:**
    - The use of `findUnique` before `create` ensures idempotency of the seeding process, preventing duplicate entries if the script is run multiple times.
    - The script directly interacts with the database using the Prisma client, making it dependent on a running database instance and correct Prisma setup.
    - The error handling is basic and could be improved by implementing retries or more specific error handling logic.  The lack of more robust error handling could lead to incomplete seeding if errors occur.
    - The script assumes the `seedsData` is correctly formatted and contains valid data for the track model.  There's no validation of the seed data before it's used.

### packages/db/prisma/migrations/20240402204828_init

<a id='packages-db-prisma-migrations-20240402204828_init-migration-sql'></a>

#### migration.sql

*Path: packages/db/prisma/migrations/20240402204828_init/migration.sql*

1. **Purpose:** This file defines the initial database schema for the application using Prisma migrations. It creates the necessary tables and enums for users, tracks, and problems, along with their relationships.

2. **Key Functionality:**

- **`CREATE TYPE "ProblemType" AS ENUM ('Blog', 'Code');`**: Defines an enum named `ProblemType` with possible values `Blog` and `Code`. This enum likely categorizes the type of problem.

- **`CREATE TABLE "User"`**: Creates the `User` table with columns:
    - `id` (TEXT, primary key): Unique identifier for the user.
    - `username` (TEXT, not null): User's username.
    - `password` (TEXT, not null): User's password.

- **`CREATE TABLE "Track"`**: Creates the `Track` table with columns:
    - `id` (TEXT, primary key): Unique identifier for the track.
    - `title` (TEXT, not null): Title of the track.
    - `description` (TEXT, not null): Description of the track.
    - `image` (TEXT, not null): URL or path to an image representing the track.
    - `hidden` (BOOLEAN, not null, default: false): Flag indicating if the track is hidden.
    - `createdAt` (TIMESTAMP, not null, default: CURRENT_TIMESTAMP): Timestamp of track creation.

- **`CREATE TABLE "Problem"`**: Creates the `Problem` table with columns:
    - `id` (TEXT, primary key): Unique identifier for the problem.
    - `title` (TEXT, not null): Title of the problem.
    - `description` (TEXT, not null): Description of the problem.
    - `notionDocId` (TEXT, not null): ID of the corresponding Notion document.
    - `type` (`ProblemType`, not null): Type of the problem (Blog or Code).

- **`CREATE TABLE "TrackProblems"`**: Creates a junction table `TrackProblems` to represent the many-to-many relationship between `Track` and `Problem`.  It has columns:
    - `trackId` (TEXT, not null, part of composite primary key, foreign key referencing `Track.id`): ID of the associated track.
    - `problemId` (TEXT, not null, part of composite primary key, foreign key referencing `Problem.id`): ID of the associated problem.

- **`ALTER TABLE "TrackProblems" ADD CONSTRAINT ...`**: These statements define foreign key constraints to enforce referential integrity between the `TrackProblems` table and the `Track` and `Problem` tables.  `ON DELETE RESTRICT` ensures that a track or problem cannot be deleted if it's referenced in the `TrackProblems` table. `ON UPDATE CASCADE` ensures that if a `trackId` or `problemId` is updated in the parent table, the corresponding entries in `TrackProblems` are also updated.

3. **Dependencies and Relationships:**

- **Dependencies:** This file depends on the Prisma ORM and the underlying database system.
- **Relationships:** This migration script creates the initial schema. Subsequent application code will interact with these tables through the Prisma Client.  The `TrackProblems` table establishes a many-to-many relationship between `Track` and `Problem`.

4. **Usage Example:**  This SQL script is executed by Prisma's migration engine as part of the database setup or upgrade process.  It's not directly used by application code.

5. **Technical Notes:**

- The use of UUIDs (represented as TEXT) for primary keys is a common practice in distributed systems.
- The `ProblemType` enum provides type safety and clarity for categorizing problems.
- The `TrackProblems` junction table is a standard way to implement many-to-many relationships in relational databases.  The choice of `RESTRICT` for `ON DELETE` behavior ensures data integrity by preventing accidental deletion of related records.  The `CASCADE` behavior for `ON UPDATE` simplifies updates by automatically propagating changes in the parent tables to the junction table.

### packages/db/prisma/migrations/20240403204246_added_mcq

<a id='packages-db-prisma-migrations-20240403204246_added_mcq-migration-sql'></a>

#### migration.sql

*Path: packages/db/prisma/migrations/20240403204246_added_mcq/migration.sql*

1. **Purpose:** This migration script adds support for Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) to the database schema. It introduces a new table for MCQ questions and extends the existing `ProblemType` enum.

2. **Key Functionality:**

- **`ALTER TYPE "ProblemType" ADD VALUE 'MCQ';`**:  Extends the `ProblemType` enum by adding a new value 'MCQ'. This allows problems to be categorized as MCQs.  No parameters or return values.

- **`CREATE TABLE "MCQQuestion"`**: Creates a new table named `MCQQuestion` with the following columns:
    - `id` (TEXT, PRIMARY KEY): Unique identifier for the MCQ question.
    - `question` (TEXT, NOT NULL): The text of the MCQ question.
    - `options` (TEXT[], array): An array of strings representing the answer options.
    - `correctOption` (TEXT, NOT NULL): The correct answer option.
    - `problemId` (TEXT, NOT NULL, FOREIGN KEY):  Links the MCQ question to a `Problem` entry.

- **`ALTER TABLE "MCQQuestion" ADD CONSTRAINT "MCQQuestion_problemId_fkey"`**: Creates a foreign key constraint between the `MCQQuestion` table and the `Problem` table. This ensures referential integrity and establishes a one-to-many relationship between `Problem` and `MCQQuestion` (one problem can have multiple MCQ questions).  The `ON DELETE RESTRICT` clause prevents deletion of a `Problem` if it has associated `MCQQuestion` entries. The `ON UPDATE CASCADE` clause ensures that if a `Problem`'s `id` is updated, the corresponding `problemId` in `MCQQuestion` is also updated.

3. **Dependencies and Relationships:**

- **Dependencies:** This migration script depends on the Prisma ORM and the existing database schema, specifically the `Problem` table and the `ProblemType` enum.
- **Relationships:** This file modifies the database schema and is executed by Prisma's migration engine. It introduces the `MCQQuestion` table and links it to the `Problem` table, establishing a relationship where a problem can have multiple associated MCQ questions.

4. **Usage Example:**  This SQL script is executed as part of the database migration process using the Prisma CLI.  For example: `npx prisma migrate deploy`.

5. **Technical Notes:**
    - The choice of `TEXT` for `id` aligns with Prisma's recommendation for UUIDs.
    - The use of an array type for `options` provides a flexible way to store multiple answer choices.
    - The foreign key constraint ensures data integrity and enforces the relationship between problems and their associated MCQ questions.  The `ON DELETE RESTRICT` clause is a crucial data integrity measure.

### packages/db/prisma/migrations/20240404031649_nextauth

<a id='packages-db-prisma-migrations-20240404031649_nextauth-migration-sql'></a>

#### migration.sql

*Path: packages/db/prisma/migrations/20240404031649_nextauth/migration.sql*

1.  **Purpose:** This SQL migration script modifies the database schema to integrate NextAuth.js for authentication. It alters the `User` table and introduces new tables for managing accounts, sessions, and verification tokens.

2.  **Key Functionality:**

    -   **`ALTER TABLE "User"`:** Modifies the existing `User` table.
        -   `DROP COLUMN "password", DROP COLUMN "username"`: Removes the existing password and username columns. This suggests a move away from traditional username/password authentication.
        -   `ADD COLUMN "email" TEXT, ADD COLUMN "emailVerified" TIMESTAMP(3), ADD COLUMN "image" TEXT, ADD COLUMN "name" TEXT`: Adds columns for email-based authentication (email, emailVerified), user profile information (image, name).

    -   **`CREATE TABLE "Account"`:** Creates a table to store user accounts linked to external providers (e.g., Google, GitHub).
        -   Columns like `provider`, `providerAccountId`, `access_token`, `refresh_token` facilitate OAuth flows.  `expires_at`, `refresh_token_expires_in` manage token lifetimes.

    -   **`CREATE TABLE "Session"`:** Creates a table to manage user sessions.
        -   `sessionToken` is used for session management. `expires` determines session validity.

    -   **`CREATE TABLE "VerificationToken"`:** Creates a table for email verification tokens.
        -   `identifier` (likely email), `token`, and `expires` are used for the verification process.

    -   **`CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ...`:** Creates unique indexes for efficient lookups and data integrity.  These are crucial for performance on queries involving these fields.

    -   **`CREATE INDEX ...`:** Creates indexes for efficient lookups and data integrity.

    -   **`ADD CONSTRAINT ...`:** Adds foreign key constraints to enforce referential integrity between tables.  `ON DELETE CASCADE` ensures dependent records are deleted when a related user is deleted.

3.  **Dependencies and Relationships:**

    -   **Dependencies:** This migration depends on the Prisma ORM and the underlying database system.
    -   **Relationships:** The `Account` and `Session` tables have a foreign key relationship with the `User` table via `userId`. This establishes a one-to-many relationship (one user can have multiple accounts and sessions).

4.  **Usage Example:** This migration script is executed by Prisma's migration engine.  It's typically run using a command like `npx prisma migrate deploy`.

5.  **Technical Notes:**

    -   The migration reflects a shift to a social login/OAuth-based authentication strategy using NextAuth.js.
    -   The use of unique indexes is crucial for performance and data integrity, especially for authentication-related queries.

*Path: packages/db/prisma/migrations/20240407230643_adds/migration.sql*

1. **Purpose:** This SQL migration script adds a new `sortingOrder` column to the `TrackProblems` table in the database.  This likely allows for ordering problems associated with a track.

2. **Key Functionality:**

- `ALTER TABLE "TrackProblems" ADD COLUMN "sortingOrder" INTEGER NOT NULL;`
    - This SQL statement adds a new column named `sortingOrder` to the `TrackProblems` table.
    - The data type is set to `INTEGER`.
    - The `NOT NULL` constraint ensures that every entry in the `TrackProblems` table must have a value for the `sortingOrder` column.

    - **Implementation and Optimizations:**  This is a standard SQL `ALTER TABLE` command.  Database performance during this migration will depend on the database engine and the size of the `TrackProblems` table.  Adding a `NOT NULL` column to a non-empty table requires existing rows to be updated with a value for this new column. The migration script does not provide a default value, indicating a potential requirement for a separate data migration step to populate this column for existing records.

    - **Fallback Mechanisms:**  Database migrations typically have transaction management built-in. If the migration fails for any reason (e.g., insufficient permissions, invalid data type), the transaction will be rolled back, leaving the database in its previous state.

3. **Dependencies and Relationships:**

- **Imports & Usage:** This migration script depends on the Prisma migration engine and the underlying database system.
- **Code Relationships:** This migration script modifies the database schema, which will affect any code that interacts with the `TrackProblems` table.  This includes any application code that reads or writes to this table.

4. **Usage Example (N/A):** Migration scripts are executed by the Prisma migration CLI.

5. **Technical Notes:**

- The `NOT NULL` constraint without a default value requires careful consideration.  Since the table is not empty, applying this migration will fail unless all existing rows are first updated with a value for `sortingOrder`. This likely necessitates a separate data migration step before or after this schema migration to populate the `sortingOrder` column for existing records.  A default value should be considered for future additions to avoid this issue.
- The choice of `INTEGER` for `sortingOrder` is appropriate for representing an ordinal ranking.  Consider using a smaller integer type if the range of possible sorting orders is limited to conserve storage space.


---


There are no other files provided, so analysis of inter-file dependencies and relationships is limited to the impact of this migration script on other parts of the application that interact with the database.  Any code that uses the `TrackProblems` table will need to be aware of the new `sortingOrder` column and handle it appropriately.  This might involve updating data models, queries, and user interfaces.

### packages/db/prisma/migrations/20240408080322_added_categories

<a id='packages-db-prisma-migrations-20240408080322_added_categories-migration-sql'></a>

#### migration.sql

*Path: packages/db/prisma/migrations/20240408080322_added_categories/migration.sql*

1. **Purpose:** This SQL migration file adds a new table named "Categories" to the database and establishes a foreign key relationship with the "Track" table.  It's part of the Prisma migration workflow, managing database schema changes.

2. **Key Functionality:**

- **`CREATE TABLE "Categories"`:** Creates the "Categories" table with the following columns:
    - `id` (TEXT, NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY): Unique identifier for each category.
    - `category` (TEXT, NOT NULL):  The name of the category.
    - `trackId` (TEXT, NOT NULL): Foreign key referencing the "Track" table.

- **`ALTER TABLE "Categories" ADD CONSTRAINT "Categories_trackId_fkey"`:**  Adds a foreign key constraint to the "Categories" table.
    - `Categories_trackId_fkey`: Name of the foreign key constraint.
    - `REFERENCES "Track"("id")`: Specifies that the `trackId` column references the `id` column of the "Track" table.
    - `ON DELETE RESTRICT`:  Restricts deleting a record in the "Track" table if a corresponding record exists in the "Categories" table.
    - `ON UPDATE CASCADE`:  If the `id` of a "Track" is updated, the corresponding `trackId` in the "Categories" table will be updated automatically.

3. **Dependencies and Relationships:**

- **Dependencies:** This migration depends on the Prisma ORM and the underlying database system. It also implicitly depends on the existence of the "Track" table.
- **Relationships:** This file directly relates to the database schema and interacts with the "Track" table by establishing a foreign key relationship.  It is part of the Prisma migrations, which are managed sequentially.  This specific migration adds to the schema defined by previous migrations.

4. **Usage Example:** This file is executed by Prisma's migration engine (e.g., `npx prisma migrate deploy`).  It's not directly called by application code.

5. **Technical Notes:**
- The `ON DELETE RESTRICT` policy ensures data integrity by preventing accidental deletion of tracks that have associated categories.
- The `ON UPDATE CASCADE` policy maintains referential integrity by automatically updating related records when a track's ID is changed.  This choice simplifies application logic as it doesn't need to handle cascading updates manually.
- The choice of `TEXT` for the `id` and `trackId` suggests these are UUIDs or similar strings, which is a common practice in distributed systems.  Using a dedicated UUID type if the database supports it would enhance type safety.

### packages/db/prisma/migrations/20240411143941_added_admin

<a id='packages-db-prisma-migrations-20240411143941_added_admin-migration-sql'></a>

#### migration.sql

*Path: packages/db/prisma/migrations/20240411143941_added_admin/migration.sql*

1. **Purpose:** This SQL migration script adds an `admin` boolean column to the `User` table.  This allows for differentiating between regular users and administrator users within the application.

2. **Key Functionality:**

- `ALTER TABLE "User" ADD COLUMN "admin" BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false;`
    - This SQL statement modifies the existing `User` table schema.
    - It adds a new column named `admin` of type `BOOLEAN`.
    - `NOT NULL` constraint ensures that every user record must have a value for the `admin` flag.
    - `DEFAULT false` sets the default value of the `admin` flag to `false` for all existing and new users unless explicitly set to `true`.

3. **Dependencies and Relationships:**

- **Dependencies:** This migration depends on the Prisma ORM and the underlying database system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL). It assumes a `User` table already exists in the database schema.
- **Code Relationships:** This migration script is part of the database migration history managed by Prisma.  It's executed sequentially with other migration scripts to evolve the database schema over time.  The application's data models (likely defined in a Prisma schema file) will need to be updated to reflect this change.

4. **Usage Example (N/A):** Migration scripts are executed automatically by Prisma's migration engine.

5. **Technical Notes:**

- This migration is additive and non-destructive. It adds a new column without altering existing data.
- The default value of `false` ensures that existing users are not inadvertently granted administrator privileges after the migration.
- Prisma manages the execution order of migrations, ensuring that database schema changes are applied consistently across environments.


---


There are no other files provided to document their interrelationships or dependencies. If other files like a Prisma schema or application code using the `User` model were provided, the documentation would detail how this migration affects those files and how they interact. For example, the Prisma schema would need to be updated to include the `admin` field in the `User` model definition, and application code could then use this field to implement authorization logic.

### packages/db/prisma/migrations/20240412144918_

<a id='packages-db-prisma-migrations-20240412144918_-migration-sql'></a>

#### migration.sql

*Path: packages/db/prisma/migrations/20240412144918_/migration.sql*

1. **Purpose:** This SQL migration script modifies the database schema by removing the `trackId` column from the `Categories` table and creating a new join table called `TrackCategory` to represent the many-to-many relationship between Tracks and Categories.  This restructuring improves database normalization and allows for more flexible relationships between tracks and categories.

2. **Key Functionality:**

- **`ALTER TABLE "Categories" DROP CONSTRAINT "Categories_trackId_fkey";`**: Drops the foreign key constraint that previously linked the `Categories` table to the `Track` table via the `trackId` column. This is necessary before the `trackId` column can be removed.
- **`ALTER TABLE "Categories" DROP COLUMN "trackId";`**: Removes the `trackId` column from the `Categories` table. This eliminates the previous one-to-many relationship (or potentially incorrect one-to-one if enforced) where a category could only belong to one track.
- **`CREATE TABLE "TrackCategory" ( ... );`**: Creates the `TrackCategory` join table with two columns: `trackId` and `categoryId`, both of type `TEXT` and forming a composite primary key. This table will store the relationships between tracks and categories.
- **`ALTER TABLE "TrackCategory" ADD CONSTRAINT "TrackCategory_trackId_fkey" ... ;`**: Adds a foreign key constraint to the `TrackCategory` table, linking the `trackId` column to the `id` column of the `Track` table.  `ON DELETE RESTRICT` ensures that a track cannot be deleted if it is referenced in the `TrackCategory` table. `ON UPDATE CASCADE` ensures that if a track's `id` is updated, the corresponding entries in `TrackCategory` are also updated.
- **`ALTER TABLE "TrackCategory" ADD CONSTRAINT "TrackCategory_categoryId_fkey" ... ;`**: Adds a foreign key constraint to the `TrackCategory` table, linking the `categoryId` column to the `id` column of the `Categories` table with similar `ON DELETE` and `ON UPDATE` cascade behavior.

3. **Dependencies and Relationships:**

- **Dependencies:** This migration script depends on the Prisma ORM and the underlying database system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).
- **Code Relationships:** This script modifies the database schema that is used by the application code.  Any code that previously relied on the `trackId` column in the `Categories` table will need to be updated to use the new `TrackCategory` table.  This likely involves changes to data access logic and potentially API endpoints related to tracks and categories.

4. **Usage Example (N/A):** Migration scripts are executed by the Prisma CLI (`prisma migrate`) and are not directly called by the application code.

5. **Technical Notes:**

- This migration reflects a shift from a potentially less flexible database design to a more robust and scalable many-to-many relationship between Tracks and Categories. The use of a join table (`TrackCategory`) is a standard practice for representing many-to-many relationships in relational databases. The `ON DELETE RESTRICT` clause helps maintain data integrity by preventing the deletion of tracks or categories that are still referenced in the join table.  Consider using `ON DELETE CASCADE` if the business logic requires deleting related entries in the `TrackCategory` table when a track or category is deleted.

### packages/db/prisma/migrations/20240412224746_code_exec

<a id='packages-db-prisma-migrations-20240412224746_code_exec-migration-sql'></a>

#### migration.sql

*Path: packages/db/prisma/migrations/20240412224746_code_exec/migration.sql*

1.  **Purpose:** This file defines the database schema for code execution, including tables for problem statements, test cases, code languages, and submissions. It establishes relationships between these entities to support the core functionality of the coding platform.

2.  **Key Functionality:**

    This SQL migration script creates the following tables and relationships:

    *   **ProblemStatement:** Stores information about a coding problem.
        *   `id`: (TEXT, Primary Key) Unique identifier for the problem statement.
        *   `problemId`: (TEXT, Unique, Foreign Key referencing `Problem`) ID of the associated problem.
        *   `mainFuncName`: (TEXT) Name of the main function to be executed.
        *   `argumentNames`: (TEXT\[]) Array of argument names for the main function.

    *   **TestCase:** Stores test cases for a problem statement.
        *   `id`: (TEXT, Primary Key) Unique identifier for the test case.
        *   `expectedOutput`: (TEXT) Expected output for the test case.
        *   `problemStatementId`: (TEXT, Foreign Key referencing `ProblemStatement`) ID of the associated problem statement.
        *   `inputs`: (TEXT\[]) Array of input values for the test case.

    *   **CodeLanguage:** Stores supported programming languages.
        *   `id`: (INTEGER, Primary Key) Unique identifier for the code language.
        *   `value`: (TEXT) Value representing the language (e.g., "python", "javascript").
        *   `label`: (TEXT) Human-readable label for the language (e.g., "Python", "JavaScript").

    *   **Submission:** Stores user code submissions.
        *   `id`: (TEXT, Primary Key) Unique identifier for the submission.
        *   `code`: (TEXT) Submitted code.
        *   `codeLanguageId`: (INTEGER, Foreign Key referencing `CodeLanguage`) ID of the used language.
        *   `statusId`: (INTEGER) Status code of the submission (e.g., success, failure).
        *   `statusDesc`: (TEXT) Description of the submission status.
        *   `runtime`: (INTEGER) Execution time in milliseconds.
        *   `memoryUsage`: (INTEGER) Memory usage in bytes.
        *   `errorMessage`: (TEXT) Error message if the submission failed.
        *   `testCasesPassed`: (INTEGER) Number of test cases passed.
        *   `problemStatementId`: (TEXT, Foreign Key referencing `ProblemStatement`) ID of the associated problem statement.
        *   `userId`: (TEXT, Foreign Key referencing `User`, nullable) ID of the submitting user.
        *   `createdAt`: (TIMESTAMP) Timestamp of submission creation.
        *   `lastTestCaseId`: (TEXT, Foreign Key referencing `TestCase`, nullable) ID of the last executed test case.
        *   `stdout`: (TEXT) Standard output of the code execution.

    *   **\_CodeLanguageToProblemStatement:** A join table representing a many-to-many relationship between `CodeLanguage` and `ProblemStatement`. This allows a problem statement to be associated with multiple code languages.

    The script also creates indexes for performance optimization, especially for foreign key relationships and unique constraints.

3.  **Dependencies and Relationships:**

    *   **Dependencies:** This migration script depends on the Prisma ORM and a database (e.g., PostgreSQL). It also implicitly depends on the existence of the `Problem` and `User` tables.
    *   **Relationships:** The tables are interconnected through foreign keys, establishing relationships between problem statements, test cases, code languages, and submissions. The `_CodeLanguageToProblemStatement` table manages the many-to-many relationship between `CodeLanguage` and `ProblemStatement`.

4.  **Usage Example:**

    This migration script is executed by the Prisma CLI during database migrations.  It alters the database schema to include the defined tables and relationships.

    ```bash
    npx prisma migrate deploy
    ```

5.  **Technical Notes:**

    *   The use of UUIDs for primary keys (`id` fields) provides globally unique identifiers.
    *   The `argumentNames` and `inputs` fields are stored as arrays, allowing for flexible handling of function parameters and test case inputs.
    *   The `_CodeLanguageToProblemStatement` join table is a standard approach for managing many-to-many relationships in relational databases.
    *   Indices are created on foreign keys and unique fields to optimize query performance.  The `problemId` unique index ensures that each problem has only one associated `ProblemStatement`. The index on `_CodeLanguageToProblemStatement` ensures efficient lookups for this many-to-many relationship.


This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the database schema defined in the migration script. It highlights the purpose of each table, their relationships, and key technical considerations. This information is crucial for understanding the data model and how it supports the functionality of the coding platform.

### packages/db/prisma/migrations/20240416173507_added_search

<a id='packages-db-prisma-migrations-20240416173507_added_search-migration-sql'></a>

#### migration.sql

*Path: packages/db/prisma/migrations/20240416173507_added_search/migration.sql*

1. **Purpose:** This SQL migration script adds a new boolean column named `inSearch` to the `Track` table in the database.  This likely supports a feature to mark specific tracks as included in a search index.

2. **Key Functionality:**

- `ALTER TABLE "Track" ADD COLUMN "inSearch" BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false;`
    - This SQL statement adds a new column to the existing `Track` table.
    - `inSearch`: The name of the new column.
    - `BOOLEAN`: The data type of the new column, indicating it stores true/false values.
    - `NOT NULL`:  A constraint ensuring that this column cannot have null values.
    - `DEFAULT false`: Sets the default value of the new column to `false` for all existing rows.  This ensures existing tracks are not immediately included in searches after the migration.

3. **Dependencies and Relationships:**

- **Dependencies:** This migration depends on the Prisma ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) and the underlying database system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).  It assumes a `Track` table already exists in the database schema.
- **Code Relationships:** This migration script is part of the database migration history managed by Prisma.  It will be executed sequentially with other migrations to evolve the database schema over time.  It likely interacts with application code that queries and updates the `inSearch` field of the `Track` table.

4. **Usage Example (N/A):** Migration scripts are executed by Prisma's migration engine, not directly by the application code.

5. **Technical Notes:**

- The `NOT NULL` constraint and `DEFAULT false` ensure data integrity by preventing null values in the `inSearch` column and providing a sensible default for existing records.
- This migration is likely related to a feature that allows users to search for tracks. The `inSearch` flag could be used to filter tracks that are included in the search index, optimizing search performance.  This suggests a relationship with code that manages search indexing and querying.

### packages/db/prisma/migrations/20240427131506_add_index

<a id='packages-db-prisma-migrations-20240427131506_add_index-migration-sql'></a>

#### migration.sql

*Path: packages/db/prisma/migrations/20240427131506_add_index/migration.sql*

1. **Purpose:** This file represents a database migration script. It's responsible for adding an index to a database table, likely for performance optimization.  This is part of the Prisma migration workflow.

2. **Key Functionality:**

    - This file likely contains SQL commands (e.g., `CREATE INDEX`, `ALTER TABLE`) to add an index to a specific table and column.  Since the file content is empty, no specific SQL commands are present. This suggests either a rollback or a placeholder migration.  A typical `CREATE INDEX` command would look like this:

    ```sql
    CREATE INDEX idx_table_column ON table_name (column_name);
    ```

    - **Parameters/Return Types:**  SQL commands don't have parameters or return types in the same way functions in programming languages do. They operate directly on the database schema.

    - **Implementation/Optimizations:**  Creating indexes generally improves the speed of lookups on the indexed column(s).  The specific optimization depends on the type of index (B-tree, hash, etc.) and the database engine.

    - **Fallback Mechanisms:**  Database migrations typically have transaction management built into the migration tool (like Prisma Migrate). If the SQL commands fail, the transaction is rolled back, preventing partial updates to the database schema.

3. **Dependencies and Relationships:**

    - **Imports & Usage:** This file is implicitly used by the Prisma Migrate tool.  It depends on the Prisma schema definition and the database engine being used.
    - **Code Relationships:** This migration file is part of a sequence of migrations managed by Prisma.  It builds upon the schema defined in previous migrations.

4. **Usage Example:**  This file is executed by the Prisma Migrate tool as part of the `prisma migrate deploy` or similar command.  It's not directly called by application code.

5. **Technical Notes:**

    - An empty migration file can be useful for creating a named migration point without actually changing the schema. This can be helpful for organizational purposes or for marking a specific point in the migration history.  However, in most cases, an empty migration file indicates an error or an incomplete migration. It's crucial to review the migration history and ensure the database schema is in the expected state.

### packages/db/prisma/migrations/20240430194543_added_mcq_submission

<a id='packages-db-prisma-migrations-20240430194543_added_mcq_submission-migration-sql'></a>

#### migration.sql

*Path: packages/db/prisma/migrations/20240430194543_added_mcq_submission/migration.sql*

1. **Purpose:** This file defines a database migration script to add the `QuizScore` table and its relationships to the existing `User` and `Problem` tables.  This migration enables storing user scores for quiz problems.

2. **Key Functionality:**

- **`CREATE TABLE "QuizScore"`:** Creates the `QuizScore` table with the following columns:
    - `id` (TEXT, PRIMARY KEY): Unique identifier for each quiz score entry.
    - `score` (INTEGER): The score achieved by the user for the problem.
    - `userId` (TEXT, FOREIGN KEY referencing `User.id`):  The user who submitted the quiz. Allows null values (user deletion). Updates cascade.
    - `problemId` (TEXT, FOREIGN KEY referencing `Problem.id`): The problem associated with the quiz score. Restricts deletion if related `QuizScore` entries exist. Updates cascade.
    - `createdAt` (TIMESTAMP): Timestamp indicating when the score was recorded. Defaults to the current timestamp.

- **`ALTER TABLE "QuizScore" ADD CONSTRAINT "QuizScore_userId_fkey"`:**  Establishes a foreign key constraint between `QuizScore.userId` and `User.id`. `ON DELETE SET NULL` ensures that if a user is deleted, their associated `userId` in `QuizScore` is set to null instead of deleting the score entry. `ON UPDATE CASCADE` ensures that if a user's `id` is updated, the change is reflected in the `QuizScore` table.

- **`ALTER TABLE "QuizScore" ADD CONSTRAINT "QuizScore_problemId_fkey"`:** Establishes a foreign key constraint between `QuizScore.problemId` and `Problem.id`. `ON DELETE RESTRICT` prevents deletion of a `Problem` if it has associated entries in `QuizScore`. `ON UPDATE CASCADE` ensures that if a problem's `id` is updated, the change is reflected in the `QuizScore` table.


3. **Dependencies and Relationships:**

- **Dependencies:** This migration script depends on the Prisma ORM and the underlying database system. It also relies on the existence of the `User` and `Problem` tables, likely created in previous migrations.
- **Relationships:** This file directly interacts with the database schema. It creates the `QuizScore` table and establishes relationships with the `User` and `Problem` tables.  This implies the existence of other files defining the schema for `User` and `Problem`.

4. **Usage Example:** This SQL script is executed by a database migration tool (like Prisma Migrate) as part of the application's deployment process.  It alters the database schema to accommodate the new `QuizScore` functionality.

5. **Technical Notes:**

- The `ON DELETE` and `ON UPDATE` clauses in the foreign key constraints define the referential integrity rules.  The chosen settings (`SET NULL` for `userId` and `RESTRICT` for `problemId`) reflect the intended behavior when related records are deleted or updated.
- The use of `TEXT` for `id` fields suggests UUIDs are being used as primary keys, which is a common practice in distributed systems.
- The `createdAt` timestamp provides an audit trail for quiz submissions.


This migration script is a crucial part of the database evolution. It introduces the `QuizScore` table, allowing the application to track user performance in quizzes. The defined relationships ensure data consistency and integrity across the database.  The choice of `RESTRICT` on `problemId` suggests that problems cannot be deleted if quiz scores are associated with them, maintaining data integrity for historical quiz results.  The `SET NULL` on `userId` allows for user deletion while preserving quiz score data, potentially for analytical purposes.

### packages/db/prisma/migrations/20240803144221_added_cohort

<a id='packages-db-prisma-migrations-20240803144221_added_cohort-migration-sql'></a>

#### migration.sql

*Path: packages/db/prisma/migrations/20240803144221_added_cohort/migration.sql*

1. **Purpose:** This SQL migration script adds a new `cohort` column to the `Track` table in the database.  This likely allows for grouping and filtering tracks based on a cohort identifier.

2. **Key Functionality:**

- `ALTER TABLE "Track" ADD COLUMN "cohort" INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;`
    - This SQL statement adds a new column named `cohort` to the `Track` table.
    - The data type is set to `INTEGER`, meaning it will store integer values.
    - `NOT NULL` constraint ensures that every track must have a cohort value assigned.
    - `DEFAULT 0` sets the default value for the `cohort` column to 0 for existing tracks.  New tracks will automatically be assigned a cohort of 0 unless explicitly specified otherwise.

3. **Dependencies and Relationships:**

- **Dependencies:** This migration script depends on the Prisma migration engine and the existing database schema. It assumes a `Track` table already exists.
- **Code Relationships:** This migration is part of the database schema evolution managed by Prisma.  It alters the `Track` table, which is likely used by other parts of the application that interact with track data.

4. **Usage Example (N/A):** Migration scripts are executed by the Prisma CLI (`prisma migrate deploy`) and are not directly used by the application code.

5. **Technical Notes:**
    - The default value of 0 for the `cohort` column ensures backward compatibility. Existing tracks will be assigned to cohort 0, preventing potential issues with null values.  This suggests cohorts were not previously tracked and this migration introduces the concept.
    - Using an integer for the `cohort` suggests a numerical representation for cohorts.  This could be a sequential identifier, a year, or some other encoded value.  A dedicated enum might be more descriptive if the possible cohort values are known and limited.


---


There were no other files provided, so only File 1 was documented.  If other files were provided, such as application code interacting with the database, the documentation would explain how those files use the `Track` table and the `cohort` column, demonstrating the relationships between the files.  For example, it might show how a query filters tracks based on the `cohort` value or how a new track is created with a specific `cohort` assigned.  This would illustrate the complete flow of data and interaction within the system.

### packages/db/prisma/migrations/20240809135031_removed_code

<a id='packages-db-prisma-migrations-20240809135031_removed_code-migration-sql'></a>

#### migration.sql

*Path: packages/db/prisma/migrations/20240809135031_removed_code/migration.sql*

1.  **Purpose:** This SQL migration script removes database entities related to code challenges, including code languages, problem statements, submissions, test cases, and their relationships. It also modifies the `ProblemType` enum, removing the `Code` variant.

2.  **Key Functionality:**

    *   **`ALTER TYPE ProblemType ...`**:  Migrates the `ProblemType` enum by removing the `Code` option. It creates a new enum type, copies existing valid values, and renames the new type to the original name. This approach ensures minimal disruption to existing data.
    *   **`DROP TABLE ...`**: Removes tables `CodeLanguage`, `ProblemStatement`, `Submission`, `TestCase`, and `_CodeLanguageToProblemStatement`. This indicates a significant shift in the application's functionality, likely moving away from code-based challenges.
    *   **`DROP CONSTRAINT ...`**: Drops foreign key constraints before dropping tables to maintain database integrity. This ensures that no orphaned records are left behind.
    *   **`BEGIN; ... COMMIT;`**: Wraps the enum alteration within a transaction block. This ensures that either all changes are applied successfully, or none are, maintaining data consistency.

3.  **Dependencies and Relationships:**

    *   **Dependencies:** This migration script depends on the Prisma ORM and the underlying database system (e.g., PostgreSQL).
    *   **Relationships:** This script impacts the `Problem` table by modifying its `type` enum. It also removes tables that were previously related to the `Problem` table and each other, indicating a decoupling of code challenge functionality.

4.  **Usage Example:** This script is executed by Prisma's migration engine as part of the database schema update process.  Typically, this would be triggered by a command like `npx prisma migrate deploy`.

5.  **Technical Notes:**

    *   The migration handles potential data loss by issuing warnings about the removal of enum values and tables.  It's crucial to back up the database before applying this migration if the removed data is needed.
    *   The use of a temporary enum type (`ProblemType_new`) during the enum alteration is a best practice to avoid potential conflicts and ensure a smooth transition.
    *   The explicit dropping of foreign key constraints before dropping tables demonstrates careful attention to database integrity.

### packages/db/prisma/migrations/20241101231656_add_canva

<a id='packages-db-prisma-migrations-20241101231656_add_canva-migration-sql'></a>

#### migration.sql

*Path: packages/db/prisma/migrations/20241101231656_add_canva/migration.sql*

1. **Purpose:** This migration script adds support for Canva links and a track type enum to the `Track` table in the database.  It extends the existing `Track` entity to accommodate different content sources.

2. **Key Functionality:**

- **`CREATE TYPE "TrackType" AS ENUM ('NOTION', 'CANVA');`**:  This statement defines a new enum type named `TrackType` with two possible values: `NOTION` and `CANVA`. This enum will be used to categorize the source of the track content.

- **`ALTER TABLE "Track" ADD COLUMN "canvaLink" TEXT, ADD COLUMN "trackType" "TrackType" NOT NULL DEFAULT 'NOTION';`**: This statement alters the existing `Track` table by adding two new columns:
    - `canvaLink`: A `TEXT` field to store the URL of a Canva design.  This allows associating Canva designs with tracks.
    - `trackType`: A column of type `TrackType` (the previously defined enum). It is set as `NOT NULL` with a default value of `NOTION`. This ensures that all existing tracks are marked as originating from Notion by default, maintaining backward compatibility.

3. **Dependencies and Relationships:**

- **Dependencies:** This migration script depends on the Prisma migration engine and the underlying database system. It assumes the existence of a `Track` table.
- **Relationships:** This migration directly modifies the `Track` table schema.  Any code interacting with the `Track` table will be affected by these changes and might need adjustments to handle the new fields.  This change likely relates to other parts of the application that handle track creation, display, and editing, potentially including frontend components and backend API endpoints.

4. **Usage Example (N/A):** Migration scripts are executed by the Prisma CLI and are not directly used by the application code.

5. **Technical Notes:**

- The default value of `'NOTION'` for the `trackType` column ensures a smooth transition for existing data.  New tracks can be explicitly assigned the `CANVA` type when created.
- The choice of `TEXT` for `canvaLink` provides flexibility for storing URLs of varying lengths.

### packages/db/src

<a id='packages-db-src-index-ts'></a>

#### index.ts

*Path: packages/db/src/index.ts*

1. **Purpose:** This file initializes and exports a Prisma client instance, ensuring a single instance is used throughout the application, especially crucial in development or serverless environments. It provides a standardized way to interact with the database.

2. **Key Functionality:**

- **`prismaClientSingleton()`:**
    - Parameters: None
    - Return Type: `PrismaClient` instance
    - Implementation: Creates a new `PrismaClient` instance from the `@prisma/client` library. This function encapsulates the instantiation logic.

- **`globalForPrisma`:**
    - Type: `GlobalThis` augmented with an optional `prisma` property of type `PrismaClientSingleton`.
    - Implementation: Leverages `globalThis` to store the Prisma client instance, preventing re-instantiation across hot reloads in development and ensuring a single instance in serverless functions.  The type augmentation ensures type safety.

- **`prisma`:**
    - Type: `PrismaClientSingleton`
    - Implementation:  This is the exported Prisma client instance. It either retrieves an existing instance from `globalForPrisma` or creates a new one using `prismaClientSingleton()`.

- **`if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production") globalForPrisma.prisma = prisma;`:**
    - Implementation: This condition ensures that the Prisma client is only stored in `globalThis` during development (non-production environments). This is crucial for preventing issues with multiple Prisma client instances in serverless functions and hot reloading.

3. **Dependencies and Relationships:**

- **Imports & Usage:** Depends on the `@prisma/client` library, which provides the Prisma client for database interactions.
- **Code Relationships:** This file is the central point of access for database operations.  Any other file interacting with the database will import and use the `prisma` instance exported from this file.

4. **Usage Example:**

```typescript
import prisma from './db'; // Assuming this file is in the same directory

async function getUser(id: number) {
  const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({ where: { id } });
  return user;
}
```

5. **Technical Notes:**

- The use of `globalThis` and the conditional assignment based on `NODE_ENV` are critical for optimizing performance and preventing issues in development and serverless deployments. This pattern ensures a single Prisma client instance, avoiding potential connection leaks and improving efficiency.
- The `PrismaClient` is initialized only once, promoting efficient resource utilization. This singleton pattern is essential for maintaining database connection consistency and preventing performance bottlenecks.  This is particularly important in serverless environments where cold starts can be impacted by redundant initializations.
- The file structure and naming conventions adhere to best practices, making the codebase maintainable and easy to understand.  The clear separation of concerns ensures that database initialization is handled in a dedicated module.

This creates a dependency between consuming modules and this index file, ensuring a single source of truth for UI component imports.

4. **Usage Example:**

```typescript
// In another component or module:
import { Button, Card } from '@shadcn/ui'; // Assuming '@shadcn/ui' resolves to this index file

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Card>
      <Button>Click me</Button>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

5. **Technical Notes:**

- This barrel export pattern simplifies importing components and promotes maintainability by centralizing the export location.  It avoids deep imports and keeps the component usage concise.
- The `@shadcn/ui` alias in the usage example assumes that the UI library is packaged and published as a separate package, and this alias is configured in the build process.

    - **Fallback Mechanisms:** Relies on standard `textarea` behavior and React error boundaries.

3. **Dependencies and Relationships:**

- **Imports & Usage:**
    - `react`: For JSX and component creation.
    - `cn` from `@repo/ui/utils`: Utility for combining CSS class names.
- **Code Relationships:** This component is a standalone UI element that can be used within other components.

4. **Usage Example:**

```tsx
<Textarea placeholder="Enter text here" />
```

5. **Technical Notes:** The `forwardRef` allows access to the underlying DOM element.  Styling is applied via Tailwind CSS classes.

#### toast.tsx

*Path: packages/ui/src/shad/ui/toast.tsx*

1. **Purpose:** This file defines a set of React components for creating toast notifications using Radix UI's `react-toast` library.

2. **Key Functionality:**

- **`ToastProvider`, `ToastViewport`, `Toast`, `ToastAction`, `ToastClose`, `ToastTitle`, `ToastDescription` (functional components, forwardRef):**
    - **Parameters:** Inherit props from `@radix-ui/react-toast`. Include `className` for custom styling. `Toast` also accepts `variant` for styling variations.
    - **Return Type:** `JSX.Element` (the corresponding toast element).
    - **Implementation:** Wraps components from `@radix-ui/react-toast` to provide styling and accessibility. Uses `cn` for class name management and `cva` for variant styling.
    - **Fallback Mechanisms:** Relies on Radix UI's internal error handling and accessibility features.

3. **Dependencies and Relationships:**

- **Imports & Usage:**
    - `@radix-ui/react-toast`: Provides the underlying toast notification functionality.
    - `@radix-ui/react-icons`: Provides icons for the close button.
    - `class-variance-authority`:  For managing variant styling.
    - `cn` from `@repo/ui/utils`: Utility for combining CSS class names.
    - `react`: For JSX and component creation.
- **Code Relationships:** These components are designed to be used together to create and manage toast notifications.  `Toaster` (in a separate file) orchestrates the display of toasts.

4. **Usage Example:**  See `Toaster` component for usage examples.

5. **Technical Notes:**  Leveraging Radix UI ensures accessibility and consistent behavior.  The `cva` library provides a clean way to manage variant styles (e.g., "default" and "destructive").

#### toaster.tsx

*Path: packages/ui/src/shad/ui/toaster.tsx*

1. **Purpose:** This file defines the `Toaster` component, which manages the display of toast notifications.

2. **Key Functionality:**

- **`Toaster` (functional component):**
    - **Parameters:** None.
    - **Return Type:** `JSX.Element` (the toaster container).
    - **Implementation:** Uses the `useToast` hook to access the list of active toasts and renders each toast using the `Toast` component from `toast.tsx`.  Includes `ToastViewport` for managing toast positions.
    - **Fallback Mechanisms:**  Relies on the `useToast` hook for toast management.

3. **Dependencies and Relationships:**

- **Imports & Usage:**
    - `Toast`, `ToastClose`, `ToastDescription`, `ToastProvider`, `ToastTitle`, `ToastViewport` from `./toast`:  The toast components.
    - `useToast` from `./use-toast`:  Hook for managing toast state.
- **Code Relationships:** This component relies on the `toast.tsx` file for the individual toast components and the `use-toast.tsx` file for managing toast state.

4. **Usage Example:**  This component is typically rendered once at the root level of the application.

5. **Technical Notes:** The `Toaster` component dynamically renders toasts based on the state managed by the `useToast` hook.

<a id='packages-ui-src-shad-ui-tooltip-tsx'></a>

#### tooltip.tsx

*Path: packages/ui/src/shad/ui/tooltip.tsx*

1. **Purpose:** This file defines a set of React components for creating tooltips using Radix UI's `react-tooltip` library.

2. **Key Functionality:**

- **`TooltipProvider`, `Tooltip`, `TooltipTrigger`, `TooltipContent` (functional components, forwardRef):**
    - **Parameters:** Inherit props from `@radix-ui/react-tooltip`. Include `className` for custom styling. `TooltipContent` also accepts `sideOffset`.
    - **Return Type:** `JSX.Element` (the corresponding tooltip element).
    - **Implementation:** Wraps components from `@radix-ui/react-tooltip` to provide styling and positioning. Uses `cn` for class name management.
    - **Fallback Mechanisms:** Relies on Radix UI's internal error handling and positioning logic.

3. **Dependencies and Relationships:**

- **Imports & Usage:**
    - `@radix-ui/react-tooltip`: Provides the underlying tooltip functionality.
    - `cn` from `@repo/ui/utils`: Utility for combining CSS class names.
    - `react`: For JSX and component creation.
- **Code Relationships:** These components are designed to be used together to create tooltips.

4. **Usage Example:**

```tsx
<TooltipProvider>
  <Tooltip>
    <TooltipTrigger>Hover me</TooltipTrigger>
    <TooltipContent>Tooltip content</TooltipContent>
  </Tooltip>
</TooltipProvider>
```

5. **Technical Notes:** Leveraging Radix UI ensures accessibility and consistent behavior. The `sideOffset` prop in `TooltipContent` controls the distance between the tooltip and the trigger element.

<a id='packages-ui-src-shad-ui-use-toast-tsx'></a>

#### use-toast.tsx

*Path: packages/ui/src/shad/ui/use-toast.tsx*

1. **Purpose:** This file defines a custom hook, `useToast`, for managing toast notifications.

2. **Key Functionality:**

- **`useToast` (hook):**
    - **Parameters:** None.
    - **Return Type:**  An object containing:
        - `toasts`: An array of active toast objects.
        - `toast`: A function to create a new toast.
        - `dismiss`: A function to dismiss a specific toast or all toasts.
    - **Implementation:** Uses a reducer pattern to manage toast state.  Provides functions for adding, updating, and dismissing toasts.  Limits the number of active toasts using `TOAST_LIMIT`.  Uses a queue (`toastTimeouts`) to remove toasts after a delay (`TOAST_REMOVE_DELAY`).
    - **Fallback Mechanisms:**  Handles toast limits and manages removal timeouts.

- **`toast` (function):**
    - **Parameters:**  A `Toast` object (excluding `id`).
    - **Return Type:** An object containing:
        - `id`: The generated ID of the toast.
        - `dismiss`: A function to dismiss the toast.
        - `update`: A function to update the toast's properties.
    - **Implementation:** Creates a new toast object with a unique ID and adds it to the toast state.

- **`reducer` (function):**  Manages the state updates based on dispatched actions.

3. **Dependencies and Relationships:**

- **Imports & Usage:**
    - `react`: For hooks and component interaction.
    - `ToastActionElement`, `ToastProps` from `./toast`:  Types for toast components.
- **Code Relationships:** This hook is used by the `Toaster` component to manage toast state.  It relies on the types defined in `toast.tsx`.

4. **Usage Example:**  See `Toaster` component for usage examples.

5. **Technical Notes:** The `useToast` hook provides a centralized way to manage toast notifications across the application.  The reducer pattern ensures predictable state updates.  The `toastTimeouts` map is used to manage the removal of toasts after a delay.  The `TOAST_LIMIT` constant prevents an excessive number of toasts from being displayed simultaneously.
